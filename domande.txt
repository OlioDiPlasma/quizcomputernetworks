Question 1
Question: What does common channel signaling involve?
Option A: The control equipment of switching centers exchanges signaling information via packet switching.
Option B: Each channel dedicated to user data transmission is associated with a different channel for signaling.
Option C: Signaling between switching centers occurs by sharing a single satellite channel.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: In common channel signaling (CCS), user information travels on separate dedicated channels (trunks), while signaling information is handled by a separate, dedicated network. A single shared signaling channel is used to control the signaling for multiple user channels. Crucially, this signaling information is exchanged between switching centers using packet switching technologies (like SS7) to ensure efficiency and speed.
Question 2
Question: What are the characteristics of a fully connected mesh topology?
Option A: High number of channels, good fault tolerance, easy routing.
Option B: High number of channels, good fault tolerance, difficult routing.
Option C: Low number of channels, poor fault tolerance, difficult routing.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: A fully connected mesh topology connects every node directly to every other node. This results in a very high number of physical links ($N(N-1)/2$). However, it offers excellent fault tolerance (if one link fails, communication is not disrupted) and makes routing extremely easy, as there is always a direct path between any pair of nodes.
Question 3
Question: Interactive conversational telecommunication services are characterized by:
Option A: Low probability of error in information transfer.
Option B: Real-time information transfer.
Option C: Storage of information in the network and deferred delivery to the recipient.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: Conversational services (like voice calls or video conferencing) require real-time interaction between human users. The most critical requirement is low delay (latency) to maintain the flow of conversation. While low error rates are desirable, real-time delivery is the defining characteristic compared to store-and-forward services.
Question 4
Question: In packet-switched networks, what factors lead to the choice of small packet sizes?
Option A: Lower incidence of control information, greater efficiency in transferring large SDUs.
Option B: Better parallelization possibility, lower transfer delay, lower bit error probability.
Option C: Better parallelization possibility, lower packetization delay, lower packet error probability.
Correct Answer: C
Motivation: Smaller packets allow for "pipelining" (sending parts of a message across different links simultaneously), which improves parallelization. They also reduce packetization delay (the time needed to fill a packet with data, crucial for voice traffic) and decrease the probability that a specific packet will contain an error (since it contains fewer bits), thereby reducing the cost of retransmission.
Question 5
Question: In the OSI model, the Transport layer provides services:
Option A: Based on services from the Application layer.
Option B: Based on services provided by the Network layer.
Option C: Based on services provided by the Session layer.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: In the ISO/OSI layered architecture, each layer $N$ utilizes the services provided by the layer immediately below it ($N-1$) to provide services to the layer above ($N+1$). Therefore, the Transport layer (Layer 4) builds upon the services provided by the Network layer (Layer 3).
Question 6
Question: Which of the following statements complies with the ISO/OSI reference model?
Option A: An (N)-entity and an (N-1)-entity can have the same address.
Option B: An (N)-entity can be associated with two different (N-1)-addresses.
Option C: Two (N)-entities can be associated with the same (N-1)-address.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: In the OSI model, an entity at layer $N$ can interact with the layer below through multiple Service Access Points (SAPs), which are identified by addresses. Therefore, a single (N)-entity can be mapped to or associated with multiple (N-1)-addresses (for example, for inverse multiplexing or load balancing purposes). Conversely, distinct (N)-entities must be addressable uniquely.
Question 7
Question: In a Go-Back-N window protocol, it might be convenient to increase the transmission window size (measured in number of data units) when:
Option A: The transmission speed increases, assuming constant data unit size and constant transfer delays between transmitter and receiver.
Option B: The transmission speed decreases, assuming constant data unit size and constant transfer delays between transmitter and receiver.
Option C: The distance between transmitter and receiver decreases (thus transfer delays decrease), without varying transmission speed.
Option D: The probability of error on the channel increases.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: The efficiency of a window protocol depends on keeping the "pipe" full. The Bandwidth-Delay Product determines how much data can be "in flight". If the transmission speed (Bandwidth) increases, the time to transmit a packet ($T_x$) decreases. To prevent the sender from stopping and waiting for ACKs (idling), the window size ($W_T$) must be increased to cover the round-trip time. $W_T$ should be proportional to the product of bandwidth and RTT.
Question 8
Question: A Go-Back-N window protocol does not require an increase in complexity compared to a Stop-And-Wait protocol regarding:
Option A: Amount of memory required at the transmitter.
Option B: Minimum quantity of sequence numbers required to distinguish data units.
Option C: Amount of memory required at the receiver.
Correct Answer: C
Motivation: In Go-Back-N, the receiver only accepts packets in perfect order. It does not buffer out-of-order packets; it simply discards them. Therefore, the receiver window size ($W_R$) is 1, which is the same as in the Stop-And-Wait protocol. The complexity increases only at the transmitter side (buffer for $N$ packets) and in the sequence numbering.
Question 9
Question: The Aloha and S-Aloha protocols:
Option A: Assign each user a fixed time slot to transmit to avoid interference on a shared broadcast channel.
Option B: Do not implement any preventive control to avoid interference; only in case of interference (collision) do they intervene by repeating transmission after a fixed delay.
Option C: Do not implement any preventive control to avoid interference; only in case of interference (collision) do they intervene by repeating transmission after a random delay.
Correct Answer: C
Motivation: Aloha and Slotted-Aloha are random access protocols. Nodes transmit whenever they have data (or at the beginning of a slot in S-Aloha) without checking if the channel is free (no Carrier Sense). If a collision occurs, they wait for a random backoff time before retransmitting. A fixed delay would cause repeated collisions if two nodes collided once.
Question 10
Question: The Internet protocol architecture is organized:
Option A: In seven layers.
Option B: In four layers.
Option C: In six layers.
Option D: In a completely non-stratified manner.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: The TCP/IP model (Internet architecture) is typically described as having 4 layers: Application, Transport (Host-to-Host), Internet (Network), and Network Interface (Link/Access). This contrasts with the 7-layer OSI model.
Question 11
Question: The TCP receiver:
Option A: Sends cumulative acknowledgments (ACKs).
Option B: Sends an acknowledgment (ACK) for every received segment.
Option C: Does not send acknowledgments.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: TCP uses cumulative acknowledgments. When the receiver sends an ACK with number $X$, it confirms that it has correctly received all bytes up to byte $X-1$ and is now expecting byte $X$. It does not necessarily send a separate ACK for every single packet (delayed ACKs are common), but the semantic is always cumulative.
Question 12
Question: The TCP segment header (the PCI of the TCP protocol):
Option A: Is always a fixed size of 20 bytes.
Option B: Has a variable size depending on the options present.
Option C: Is a fixed size of 40 bytes.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: The standard TCP header is 20 bytes long, but it has an "Options" field that can extend the header up to a maximum total of 60 bytes. Therefore, the size is variable (indicated by the Data Offset field in the header).
Question 13
Question: Logical addresses in the Internet are:
Option A: Determined completely freely by the system administrators of each subnet.
Option B: Organized into domains (hierarchical).
Option C: Of completely free format.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: IP addresses (logical addresses) are hierarchical. They consist of a network portion (prefix) and a host portion. This organization allows for scalable routing (CIDR) and grouping into subnets and Autonomous Systems, rather than a flat, random assignment.
Question 14
Question: Between AS (Autonomous Systems), the routing protocol used can be:
Option A: EGP (Exterior Gateway Protocol) / BGP.
Option B: RIP (Routing Information Protocol).
Option C: OSPF (Open Shortest Path First).
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: Protocols used to exchange routing information between different Autonomous Systems are classified as Exterior Gateway Protocols (EGP). The current standard is BGP (Border Gateway Protocol). RIP and OSPF are Interior Gateway Protocols (IGP) used within a single AS. Note: The quiz uses "EGP" as a generic term for the class of protocols, though a specific legacy protocol was also named EGP.
Question 15
Question: In the OSI model, an (N)-connection:
Option A: Can be realized using one or more (N-1)-connections.
Option B: Is terminated by two (N-1)-CEPs.
Option C: Can be realized using one or more (N+1)-connections.
Option D: Can be realized only using multiple (N-1)-connections.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: This concept refers to "splitting" or "multiplexing". An (N)-layer can map a single connection to multiple underlying (N-1) connections to increase throughput (splitting). Conversely, multiple (N) connections can be multiplexed onto a single (N-1) connection to save costs. Therefore, mapping one to one-or-more is valid.
Question 16
Question: Compared to the 10 Mbit/s Ethernet standard, in the definition of 100 Mbit/s Ethernet, the MAC protocol:
Option A: Was modified to allow more efficient collision detection.
Option B: Was modified by introducing a mechanism to avoid collisions, improve performance, and support real-time services.
Option C: Was kept unchanged, accepting the reduction of the "collision domain" by a factor of about ten.
Option D: Was kept unchanged, maintaining the maximum dimension unchanged but increasing the minimum frame size by a factor of ten.
Correct Answer: C
Motivation: Fast Ethernet (100 Mbit/s) wanted to keep the same frame format and MAC protocol (CSMA/CD) as 10 Mbit/s Ethernet for backward compatibility. Since the bit rate increased by 10x, the time to transmit a bit decreased by 10x. To ensure collisions could still be detected while the frame was being transmitted, the maximum round-trip delay (and thus the maximum network diameter/collision domain) had to be reduced by a factor of 10.
Question 17
Question: The metric (cost) in a routing algorithm:
Option A: Expresses the weight to be assigned to a link (channel) in the path selection.
Option B: Expresses the computational complexity of the algorithm.
Option C: Expresses the probability that the shortest path is utilized.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: Routing algorithms use a "metric" or "cost" associated with each network link to calculate the best path. This cost can represent bandwidth, delay, hop count, or monetary cost. The algorithm seeks to minimize the total cost of the path.
Question 18
Question: The advantages of virtual circuit services compared to datagram services in a packet-switched network are:
Option A: Lower packet delay, routing calculation for every packet.
Option B: Lower variability in packet delays, maintenance of packet sequence, routing for every packet.
Option C: Lower variability in packet delays, maintenance of packet sequence, routing only during the connection setup phase.
Correct Answer: C
Motivation: In virtual circuit networks, the path is established once during setup. All subsequent packets follow the same path. This ensures packets arrive in order (maintenance of sequence) and experience consistent delays (less jitter) because no routing decision is made per packet, only forwarding based on the virtual circuit label.
Question 19
Question: Which of the following statements is true regarding IEEE 802.1d Transparent Bridges?
Option A: Routing follows "backward learning" and flooding criteria.
Option B: Routing is based on the exchange of routing tables between bridges.
Option C: Routing always happens via flooding.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: Transparent bridges use "backward learning" (or source learning) to populate their forwarding tables by observing the source MAC addresses of incoming frames. If the destination MAC is not in the table, the bridge floods the frame out of all ports (except the incoming one). They do not exchange routing tables like layer 3 routers.
Question 20
Question: Compared to Fast Ethernet at 100 Mb/s (100Base-T), Ethernet at 1 Gb/s allows respecting time constraints on collision recognition by:
Option A: Decreasing the distance between nodes.
Option B: Imposing optical fiber as the transmission medium.
Option C: Increasing the minimum size of the PDUs (or using carrier extension).
Correct Answer: C
Motivation: At 1 Gb/s, the bit time is so short that a standard 64-byte frame would be transmitted before a collision could propagate across a reasonable cable length. To maintain a usable network diameter without changing the fundamental CSMA/CD mechanism too drastically, the standard increased the effective minimum transmission time (via "Carrier Extension" to 512 bytes), ensuring the sender stays active long enough to detect a collision.
Question 21
Question: Compared to CBR (Constant Bit Rate) sources, VBR (Variable Bit Rate) sources:
Option A: Have a greater difference between maximum and minimum transmission speeds.
Option B: Have stricter requirements on maximum delay.
Option C: Have stricter requirements on average delay.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: CBR sources transmit at a fixed rate (Max = Min). VBR sources produce traffic in bursts, meaning there is a significant variation (peak vs. average) in the data rate over time. This high "burstiness" is the defining difference.
Question 22
Question: End-to-end error recovery in the Internet environment, when present:
Option A: Is performed always and only by application processes.
Option B: Is performed at the Transport layer.
Option C: Is performed at the Internet (Network) layer.
Option D: Is not provided for any type of service.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: The IP layer (Network layer) provides a "best effort" service and does not guarantee delivery. Reliable delivery and error recovery are responsibilities of the Transport layer, specifically via the TCP protocol (Transmission Control Protocol), which handles retransmissions end-to-end.
Question 23
Question: The POP3 protocol:
Option A: Is used for blocking pop-ups in a web browser.
Option B: Is used for the exchange of email messages between mail servers.
Option C: Can be used to transfer email messages from a server to an email client installed on a PC.
Option D: Uses messages that always include encrypted authentication.
Correct Answer: C
Motivation: POP3 (Post Office Protocol version 3) is a standard protocol used by email clients to retrieve/download emails from a remote server to a local device. Exchange between servers is handled by SMTP.
Question 24
Question: What is meant by "collision domain" in Ethernet?
Option A: The portion of the network within which a single collision is detected/propagated.
Option B: The number of bits in the packet header that can be damaged by a collision.
Option C: The set of nodes that stop transmission due to a collision.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: A collision domain is a network segment where data packets can collide with one another when being sent on a shared medium. If two devices in the same collision domain transmit simultaneously, a collision occurs, and all devices in that domain hear it. Switches break up collision domains; hubs extend them.
Question 25
Question: In an IP Subnet (Logical IP Subnet):
Option A: Hosts share the same network prefix.
Option B: The network prefix is always constituted by the first three bytes of the address.
Option C: Hosts always communicate by passing through the router.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: An IP subnet is defined by a common address prefix (NetID) shared by all hosts within that physical or logical segment. The length of this prefix is determined by the subnet mask (it is not fixed to 3 bytes/24 bits, unlike the old Class C definition). Hosts within the same subnet communicate directly without passing through a default gateway (router).
Question 26
Question: In the OSI reference model, an (N)-PCI (Protocol Control Information) can contain:
Option A: (N)-addresses.
Option B: (N+1)-addresses.
Option C: (N-1)-addresses.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: The PCI (Header) of layer $N$ contains control information needed by the peer entity at layer $N$. This includes addressing relevant to that layer ($N$-addresses) to identify the sender and receiver entities at that specific level.
Question 27
Question: The TCP protocol:
Option A: Provides error detection on the data of every segment using a checksum.
Option B: Provides error detection only on the segment header.
Option C: Does not provide error detection and recovery on data.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: TCP ensures data integrity by including a checksum field in its header. This checksum is calculated over the TCP header, the payload (data), and a "pseudo-header" (IP addresses). If the checksum fails at the receiver, the segment is discarded, assuming data corruption.
Question 28
Question: The P/F (Poll/Final) bit of frames in the Layer 2 LaPB protocol:
Option A: Provides an implicit confirmation on frames not yet confirmed.
Option B: Allows soliciting the sending of a confirmation/response from the receiver.
Option C: Accelerates the transmission of information.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: In HDLC-based protocols like LAPB, setting the Poll bit (P) to 1 commands the receiver to send a response immediately (with the Final bit set to 1). It is essentially a way for the primary station to force a status update or acknowledgment from the secondary station.
Question 29
Question: Which of the following protocols does NOT perform data unit delimitation functions?
Option A: LaPB, used in ISDN B channel.
Option B: LaPF, used in Frame Relay networks.
Option C: PPP, used in domestic Internet access.
Option D: IEEE 802.2 LLC (Logical Link Control), used in local networks.
Correct Answer: D
Motivation: Framing (delimiting start and end of a packet) is typically a function of the MAC sublayer or the physical layer in LANs. IEEE 802.2 LLC handles Logical Link Control (multiplexing, flow control) but relies on the underlying MAC layer (like Ethernet 802.3) to handle the framing and delimitation (preamble, start frame delimiter). Protocols like HDLC/PPP handles their own framing flags (e.g., 01111110).
Question 30
Question: What is indispensable for Ethernet in full-duplex mode?
Option A: The possibility to receive and transmit packets simultaneously.
Option B: The availability of fault protection techniques through two disjoint paths between every pair of nodes.
Option C: Full support for both 10 Mbit/s and 100 Mbit/s speeds.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: Full-duplex communication means data can flow in both directions at the same time. Physically, this requires separate dedicated wires (or channels) for transmission and reception within the cable, eliminating collisions and the need for CSMA/CD.
Question 31
Question: The characteristics of a tree topology are:
Option A: Low number of channels, poor fault tolerance, easy routing.
Option B: Low number of channels, good fault tolerance, easy routing.
Option C: High number of channels, good fault tolerance, difficult routing.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: A tree topology uses a minimal number of links ($N-1$ for $N$ nodes), similar to a star but hierarchical. This makes it cost-effective (low channels). However, fault tolerance is poor because if a parent node or link fails, the entire subtree is isolated. Routing is easy/deterministic because there is only one path between any two nodes.
Question 32
Question: IPv4 addresses are:
Option A: Of fixed total length, composed of a variable-length part identifying the network and a variable-length part identifying the host.
Option B: Of fixed total length, composed of a fixed-length part identifying the network and a fixed-length part identifying the host.
Option C: Of variable length, composed of a variable-length part identifying the network and a variable-length part identifying the host.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: IPv4 addresses are always 32 bits long (fixed total length). However, the boundary between the Network ID and the Host ID is not fixed; it varies depending on the subnet mask (CIDR), allowing for flexible allocation of address space.
Question 33
Question: In Store-And-Forward packet-switching networks, the use of large PDUs (packets):
Option A: Decreases the probability of losing information due to bit errors.
Option B: Minimizes transfer delay because there is less overhead.
Option C: Requires a larger header.
Option D: Increases the overall information transfer delay because each node must receive the entire PDU before it can send it on the next channel.
Correct Answer: D
Motivation: In store-and-forward switching, a switch must receive the entire packet before it can start transmitting it to the next hop (to check for errors and determine the route). Large packets take longer to arrive fully (serialization delay), thus increasing the accumulation of delays at every hop compared to breaking the data into smaller packets (pipelining).
Question 34
Question: A Selective Repeat protocol with transmission window $W_T$ and reception window $W_R$:
Option A: Can function only if, with $k$ being the number of numbering bits, $W_T + W_R \le 2^k$.
Option B: Can function only if $W_T \le 2^k$.
Option C: Can function only if $W_R \le 2^k$.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: To avoid ambiguity between new packets and retransmissions of old packets when ACKs are lost, the range of sequence numbers ($2^k$) must be large enough to cover both the sending window and the receiving window. The strict condition for Selective Repeat is $W_T + W_R \le 2^k$. (Often $W_T = W_R$, so $2 W_T \le 2^k$).
Question 35
Question: The PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol):
Option A: Uses a Go-Back-N window protocol.
Option B: Uses the address field to distinguish commands from responses.
Option C: Uses the sequence 01111110 to delimit data units, similar to LaPB (ISDN channel B).
Correct Answer: C
Motivation: PPP is heavily based on HDLC. It uses the standard HDLC flag byte 01111110 (0x7E) to mark the beginning and end of a frame.
Question 36
Question: The PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol) [Duplicate Question]:
Option A: Uses a Go-Back-N window protocol.
Option B: Uses the address field to distinguish commands from responses.
Option C: Uses the sequence 01111110 to delimit data units.
Correct Answer: C
Motivation: Duplicate of question 35. The answer remains that PPP uses the flag sequence 01111110 for framing.
Question 37
Question: Which of the following performances are possible thanks to Store-And-Forward functioning in a packet network?
Option A: The possibility of having different transmission speeds between different channels attached to the same switch.
Option B: Reduction of transfer delays.
Option C: Reduction of packet header size.
Option D: Forward Error Correction.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: Store-and-forward allows a device to receive a packet at one speed (e.g., 10 Mbps), store it in memory, and then transmit it out of another interface at a different speed (e.g., 100 Mbps). This speed adaptation is not possible in pure circuit switching or cut-through switching without buffering.
Question 38
Question: The difference between teleservices, bearer services, and supplementary services lies in the fact that:
Option A: Bearer services offer only information transfer between user-network interfaces; teleservices involve user equipment functions according to established protocols; supplementary services modify or integrate a bearer service and a teleservice.
Option B: Teleservices offer only transfer; bearer services involve user equipment; supplementary services are special data transfer services.
Option C: While bearer services offer only information transfer between user-network interfaces, teleservices involve the functions of user equipment according to pre-established protocols; supplementary services are special services for data transfer.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: This follows ISDN terminology. Bearer services provide the basic capability to transmit signals (Layer 1-3). Teleservices (like telephony or fax) provide full end-to-end capability including terminal equipment functions (Layers 1-7). Supplementary services (like Call Waiting) cannot stand alone; they augment bearer or teleservices.
Question 39
Question: According to the OSI model, functions in a telecommunications network are:
Option A: Operations available on a service interface.
Option B: Interaction rules between entities of the same layer.
Option C: Operations performed inside an architectural layer.
Correct Answer: C
Motivation: In the OSI context, a "function" refers to the specific processing or operations carried out within a layer (e.g., routing, encryption, segmentation) to provide the service to the layer above. Interaction rules are "protocols", and operations at the interface are "services".
Question 40
Question: Consider a transmitter using TCP and a receiver with infinite speed (always advertising max window). Given a current transmitter window ($cwnd$) of 10 segments, and a receiver max window ($rwnd$) of 20 segments. When the transmitter receives a segment containing an ACK, what is a possible situation?
Option A: Current transmitter window becomes 3.
Option B: Current transmitter window becomes 51.
Option C: Current transmitter window becomes 11.
Option D: Current transmitter window becomes 13.
Correct Answer: C
Motivation: If the transmitter is in the Slow Start phase, receiving a new ACK increases the Congestion Window ($cwnd$) by 1 Maximum Segment Size (MSS). So, $10 + 1 = 11$. If it were in Congestion Avoidance, it would increase by a fraction, but 11 is the only logical step forward among the choices for a successful transmission scenario.
Question 41
Question: The Domain Name System (DNS):
Option A: Allows assigning an Ethernet address to a host based on its IP.
Option B: Performs OSI mapping between (3)-addresses and (2)-addresses.
Option C: Allows an application to know the IP address of a web site whose logical name is known.
Option D: Allows knowing the physical location of an Internet host.
Correct Answer: C
Motivation: The primary function of DNS is hostname resolution: translating human-readable domain names (e.g., www.google.com) into machine-routable IP addresses. Option A describes ARP, not DNS.
Question 42
Question: Given a number of nodes and channels, a topology T1 where the average distance between nodes is smaller than another topology T2, in the presence of uniformly distributed traffic:
Option A: Can handle the same amount of traffic.
Option B: Can handle less traffic.
Option C: Can handle a greater quantity of traffic.
Correct Answer: C
Motivation: Throughput is inversely proportional to the average path length (average hops). If the average distance is smaller (T1), each packet consumes network resources (links) for fewer hops. This leaves more resources available for other packets, increasing the total saturation throughput of the network.
Question 43
Question: The piggybacking technique in window protocols consists of the possibility to:
Option A: Return to the transmitter any data units that suffered transmission errors.
Option B: Concatenate multiple acknowledgments in a data unit.
Option C: Transport acknowledgment information and user data in the same data unit.
Option D: Have the receiver explicitly signal data unit losses to the transmitter.
Correct Answer: C
Motivation: Piggybacking is an efficiency technique used in full-duplex communication. Instead of sending a separate control packet just to say "ACK", the receiver waits briefly to see if it has its own data to send to the transmitter. If so, it attaches (piggybacks) the ACK to the outgoing data frame header.
Question 44
Question: Distinguishing commands and responses in Layer 2 LaPB protocol frames aims to:
Option A: Understand if a Poll bit or Final bit was sent.
Option B: Understand who the recipient of the frame is.
Option C: Distinguish supervision frames from information frames.
Correct Answer: C
Motivation: In HDLC/LAPB, the address field differentiates commands (sent by primary, expecting action) from responses (sent by secondary). While the primary purpose is distinguishing the role of the frame in the control flow, in the context of the quiz options, it aids in correctly interpreting the frame type and the P/F bit context, effectively distinguishing supervisory functions from data transfer contexts properly. Correction Note: The original motivation points to distinguishing frame types. Strictly speaking, the Frame Type (I, S, U) is determined by the Control field, not Command/Response bit. However, the Command/Response bit is crucial for the logical flow (Supervision) of the link.
Question 45
Question: In a local area network (LAN) on a bus topology with CSMA access protocol, the amount of time for which various nodes detect a collision between transmissions of two particular nodes:
Option A: Is greater for nodes near the ends of the bus.
Option B: Is the same for all nodes.
Option C: Depends on the position of the nodes relative to the transmitters generating the collision.
Option D: Depends on signal propagation speed.
Correct Answer: C
Motivation: A collision is a physical interference of signals. Since signals take time to propagate down the bus, nodes physically closer to the point of collision (or the transmitters) might detect the interference pattern at slightly different times and for different durations compared to distant nodes, depending on the overlap geometry of the signals.
Question 46
Question: In the OSI model, the Transport layer provides services:
Option A: Based on services from the Application layer.
Option B: Based on services provided by the Network layer.
Option C: Based on services provided by the Session layer.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: Repeat of Quiz 5. The Transport layer sits above the Network layer and utilizes its services (routing, addressing) to provide end-to-end data delivery to the layers above.
Question 47
Question: The header of a data packet in a packet-switched network with datagram service contains:
Option A: Source and destination node addresses.
Option B: Destination address and a connection identifier.
Option C: A connection identifier.
Option D: Source address and a connection identifier.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: In datagram networks (like IP), every packet is treated independently. Therefore, every packet must carry the full global address of the destination (to be routed) and the source (for replies). Connection identifiers are used in Virtual Circuit networks, not datagrams.
Question 48
Question: Compared to the 10 Mbit/s Ethernet standard, in the definition of 100 Mbit/s Ethernet, the MAC protocol:
Option A: Modified for collision avoidance.
Option B: Kept unchanged, accepting the reduction of the maximum "collision domain" size by a factor of ten.
Option C: Kept unchanged, increasing minimum frame size.
Option D: Modified for better collision detection.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: Similar to Question 16, but framed slightly differently. To keep the MAC unchanged (same minimum frame size of 64 bytes) while increasing speed to 100 Mbps, the maximum round-trip time allowed for collision detection had to be maintained in terms of bit times. In terms of physical distance, this meant the network span (collision domain) had to be reduced by approx. factor of 10 (from ~2500m to ~200m).
Question 49
Question: The PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol):
Option A: Uses Go-Back-N.
Option B: Uses address field to distinguish user/operator.
Option C: Uses a known sequence of bits to delimit data units.
Correct Answer: C
Motivation: Repeat of Quiz 35/36. PPP uses the flag 01111110 for framing delimitation.
Question 50
Question: An IP router, after calculating routing:
Option A: Modifies source and destination IP addresses.
Option B: Modifies Time To Live and Header Checksum fields in the datagram header.
Option C: Modifies exclusively the Time To Live field.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: A router MUST decrement the TTL (Time To Live) field of every IP packet it forwards to prevent loops. Since the TTL is part of the header, and the IP Header Checksum is calculated over the header contents, changing the TTL invalidates the old checksum. Therefore, the router must also re-calculate and update the Header Checksum. It does not typically change source/destination IP addresses (unless it is performing NAT, which is a specific function, not standard routing).
Question 51
Question: An Ethernet card in a switch processes (i.e., reads and decides if/how to forward):
Option A: Only packets with a broadcast destination MAC address.
Option B: All packets, regardless of the destination address.
Option C: Only packets with a unicast destination MAC address matching that of the switch.
Option D: Only packets with a multicast destination MAC address.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: A switch acts as a transparent bridge. To perform its function—filtering and forwarding frames to the correct segment—it must examine the destination MAC address of every single frame arriving on its ports. It checks its forwarding table (CAM table) to decide whether to forward the frame to a specific port, flood it to all ports, or filter it (drop it if the destination is on the same segment).
Question 52
Question: Which of the following statements is true? A host connected to the Internet, when it wants to transmit/receive data to/from any other Internet host, must know:
Option A: Its own IP address and subnet mask, its own MAC address, the IP address of the default router (gateway), and the IP address of a DNS server.
Option B: Only its own MAC address.
Option C: Only its own IP address.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: For full Internet connectivity, a host needs:
1. IP Address & Subnet Mask: To identify itself and determine if a destination is local or remote.
2. MAC Address: To communicate at Layer 2 (though this is burned into the hardware, the OS must know it).
3. Default Gateway IP: To forward packets destined for remote networks.
4. DNS Server IP: To resolve human-readable domain names (like https://www.google.com/search?q=google.com) into IP addresses.
Question 53
Question: "Switching" refers to:
Option A: The transfer of information from one point to one or more other points.
Option B: The exchange of information regarding control and management of a telecommunications network.
Option C: The process of interconnecting resources for the time necessary for communication.
Correct Answer: C
Motivation: Switching is the core function of network nodes (switches/routers) that creates a temporary path or association between an input link and an output link. It allocates resources (physically in circuit switching, or logically/buffer-space in packet switching) to allow data to move from source to destination. Option A defines "Transmission", and B defines "Signaling".
Question 54
Question: In the OSI model, the Network layer provides services:
Option A: Based on services provided by the Application layer.
Option B: Based on services provided by the Transport layer.
Option C: Based on services provided by the Data Link layer.
Correct Answer: C
Motivation: Following the strict hierarchy of the OSI model, Layer $N$ (Network, Layer 3) provides services to Layer $N+1$ (Transport) by utilizing the services of Layer $N-1$ (Data Link, Layer 2).
Question 55
Question: In a real mobile radio channel, the phenomenon of "fading" consists of:
Option A: Decrease in received power caused by the distance between transmitter and receiver.
Option B: Rapid variation in received power caused by sources operating at the same frequency.
Option C: Decrease in received power caused by atmospheric sources such as rain and snow.
Option D: Rapid variation in received power caused by the presence of obstacles and movement (multipath).
Correct Answer: D
Motivation: Fading (specifically small-scale or Rayleigh fading) is caused by multipath propagation. The signal reaches the receiver via multiple paths (reflections, refractions) with different phases. As the device or obstacles move, these signals interfere constructively or destructively, causing rapid fluctuations in signal strength. Option A describes "Path Loss".
Question 56
Question: In the IP header (the PCI of the IP protocol), which of the following are obligatorily contained?
Option A: The IP address of a source and a destination.
Option B: The port of a source and a destination.
Option C: The Window field that allows the receiver to signal the current size of the reception window.
Option D: The MAC address of source and destination.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: The primary function of the IP protocol is addressing and routing. Therefore, the IP header must contain the 32-bit Source IP Address and the 32-bit Destination IP Address to ensure the packet can be routed through the network and a reply can be sent. Ports (B) are in the Transport header (TCP/UDP), and MAC addresses (D) are in the Ethernet frame header.
Question 57
Question: The IP protocol:
Option A: Guarantees error detection only on the datagram header.
Option B: Guarantees error detection on the header and the content of the datagram.
Option C: Does not provide any type of protection against errors.
Option D: Guarantees error detection only on the content of the datagram.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: IPv4 includes a "Header Checksum" field. This checksum protects only the IP header to ensure routing information (like destination IP) is correct. It does not protect the data payload; data integrity is left to upper layers (TCP/UDP) or lower layers (CRC in Ethernet). Note: IPv6 removed the header checksum entirely.
Question 58
Question: The greater complexity of the Go-Back-N protocol compared to the Stop-And-Wait protocol is due to:
Option A: The greater complexity of the transmitter.
Option B: The greater complexity of the receiver.
Option C: The greater complexity of both receiver and transmitter.
Option D: The management of receiver timeouts.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: In Go-Back-N, the receiver remains simple (window size = 1, just accepts or drops). The transmitter, however, must manage a window of size $N > 1$. It needs to buffer multiple unacknowledged packets, handle a timer for the oldest unacknowledged packet, and be capable of re-sending a whole batch of packets upon timeout.
Question 59
Question: The use of cookies in the HTTP protocol allows:
Option A: Associating multiple requests made by the same browser or user.
Option B: Caching received responses.
Option C: Downloading all objects contained in a page by opening a single TCP connection.
Option D: Sending the response to the client using different fragments (Chunked Transfer).
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: HTTP is inherently a stateless protocol; the server does not remember past requests. Cookies are small pieces of data sent by the server and stored by the browser. They are resent with subsequent requests, allowing the server to identify the user session (e.g., maintaining login state or a shopping cart) across multiple separate HTTP requests.
Question 60
Question: In a fully connected mesh topology with N nodes, the number of bidirectional channels is equal to:
Option A: $N(N-1)/2$
Option B: $2N$
Option C: $N-1$
Option D: $N$
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: In a full mesh, every node connects to every other node. The first node connects to $N-1$ others, the second to $N-2$ (excluding the one already counted), and so on. The sum is $1 + 2 + ... + (N-1)$, which equals $\frac{N(N-1)}{2}$.
Question 61
Question: The IP protocol provides a service that is:
Option A: Unreliable (no delivery guarantee) and connectionless.
Option B: Reliable (guaranteed delivery) and connectionless.
Option C: Unreliable (no delivery guarantee) and connection oriented.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: IP is a "best-effort" protocol. It treats each packet independently (connectionless) and does not verify if the packet actually reaches the destination (unreliable). It relies on higher-layer protocols (like TCP) to provide reliability if needed.
Question 62
Question: Compared to the IP protocol, the UDP protocol:
Option A: Adds nothing.
Option B: Adds the ability to transport messages distinguishing between different application processes on the same host.
Option C: Allows reliable transport of information.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: While IP handles host-to-host delivery (addressing the machine), UDP (User Datagram Protocol) adds process-to-process delivery via Ports. The Source Port and Destination Port fields in the UDP header allow the operating system to multiplex and demultiplex data to the correct application (socket).
Question 63
Question: CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing), based on the use of netmasks in IP addresses, is a technique used to:
Option A: Decrease the convergence time of routing protocols.
Option B: Efficiently use the IP address space and reduce routing table size.
Option C: Avoid the formation of routing loops.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: CIDR moved away from the rigid Class A/B/C structure. It allows for variable-length subnet masks (VLSM). This reduces IP waste (allocating only the needed addresses) and allows "Route Aggregation" (Supernetting), where a single routing entry can represent a large block of contiguous IP addresses, keeping global routing tables smaller.
Question 64
Question: Which of the following line codings is more efficient, i.e., requires a lower bit rate at the physical layer for the same information rate transmitted?
Option A: 4B5B Coding
Option B: 64B66B Coding
Option C: 8B10B Coding
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: Efficiency is the ratio of data bits to total bits transmitted.
* 4B5B: 4 data bits / 5 total bits = 80% efficiency (25% overhead).
* 8B10B: 8 data bits / 10 total bits = 80% efficiency (25% overhead).
* 64B66B: 64 data bits / 66 total bits $\approx$ 97% efficiency (only ~3% overhead).
Therefore, 64B66B requires the least extra bandwidth.
Question 65
Question: Which of the following line codings is more efficient? [Duplicate Question]
Option A: 4B5B Coding
Option B: 64B66B Coding
Option C: 8B10B Coding
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: Duplicate of Question 64. 64B66B is the most efficient.
Question 66
Question: The DSL access network separates data and voice on the same transmission medium between user equipment and central office equipment using:
Option A: Time Division Multiplexing.
Option B: Frequency Division Multiple Access.
Option C: Time Division Multiple Access.
Option D: Frequency Multiplexing (FDM).
Correct Answer: D
Motivation: DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) utilizes the existing copper telephone wire. It coexists with standard analog telephone service (POTS) by operating at higher frequencies. Splitters (filters) are used to separate the low-frequency voice signals (0-4 kHz) from the high-frequency data signals (> 25 kHz), effectively implementing Frequency Division Multiplexing.
Question 67
Question: The Stop-And-Wait protocol:
Option A: Can work only using more than one numbering bit.
Option B: Can work using a number of numbering bits greater than or equal to 1.
Option C: Can only work using a single numbering bit.
Option D: Can work only using a number of numbering bits lower than the transmission window size.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: Stop-And-Wait is essentially a sliding window protocol with a window size of 1. To distinguish between a new packet and a retransmission of the previous packet (in case of ACK loss), a single bit (0 or 1) is sufficient. Using more bits is allowed but unnecessary. Therefore, $\ge 1$ bit is correct.
Question 68
Question: In a tree topology with N nodes, the number of bidirectional channels is equal to:
Option A: N
Option B: N-1
Option C: 2N
Option D: $N(N-1)/2$
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: A tree is a graph with no cycles. The minimum number of edges (channels) required to connect $N$ nodes without forming a loop is exactly $N-1$.
Question 69
Question: In the UDP header (the PCI of the UDP protocol), which of the following are obligatorily contained?
Option A: The Maximum Segment Size value negotiated between transmitter and receiver.
Option B: The checksum field, for error detection.
Option C: Some flags (in the CODE field) for opening and closing the connection.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: The UDP header is very simple (8 bytes). It contains Source Port, Destination Port, Length, and Checksum. While the checksum is technically optional in IPv4 (can be all zeros), the field itself is always present in the header structure. UDP does not have connection flags (SYN/FIN) or MSS negotiation because it is connectionless.
Question 70
Question: The transport layer in the Internet:
Option A: Provides reliable information transport if the UDP protocol is used.
Option B: Provides only unreliable transport.
Option C: Always provides reliable information transport.
Option D: Provides reliable information transport if the TCP protocol is used.
Correct Answer: D
Motivation: The Internet Transport Layer offers two main protocols: UDP (Unreliable, connectionless) and TCP (Reliable, connection-oriented). Reliability (guaranteed delivery, ordering, error check) is specifically a feature of TCP.
Question 71
Question: In an IP router's routing table, there is a mask where the first 24 bits (most significant) are 1 and the last 8 bits are 0 (/24). Which statement is true?
Option A: The mask can be associated with a "subnetted" Class B address.
Option B: The mask is definitely associated with a "subnetted" Class A address.
Option C: The mask cannot be associated with a Class C address.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: A /24 mask corresponds to 255.255.255.0.
   * Class A default mask is /8. Subnetting to /24 is possible.
   * Class B default mask is /16. Subnetting to /24 is possible (borrowing 8 bits).
   * Class C default mask is /24.
Therefore, a /24 mask can be used with a Class B network that has been divided into smaller subnets. It is not exclusively for Class C.
Question 72
Question: A Go-Back-N protocol with a transmission window of size $W_t$:
Option A: Can work only using a number of numbering bits $\ge \log_2(W_t)$.
Option B: Can work only using a number of numbering bits $\ge \log_2(W_t-1)$.
Option C: Can only work using a number of numbering bits $\ge \log_2(W_t+1)$.
Correct Answer: C
Motivation: In Go-Back-N, the sequence number space $N$ (where $N=2^k$) must be strictly larger than the window size $W_t$ to distinguish between a new frame and a retransmission. The constraint is $W_t < 2^k$ (or $W_t \le 2^k - 1$).
Therefore, $2^k \ge W_t + 1$. Taking the log, $k \ge \log_2(W_t + 1)$.
Question 73
Question: ADSL (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line) technology:
Option A: Was designed mainly to provide voice/data access to a residential user who predominantly accesses the Web as a client.
Option B: Was designed mainly to interconnect local networks over long distances.
Option C: Was designed mainly to provide pure data access to a Web service provider.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: "Asymmetric" refers to the fact that download speed (from Network to User) is much higher than upload speed (from User to Network). This fits the profile of a residential user (browsing, streaming) who consumes much more data than they produce.
Question 74
Question: The quality characteristics required by a telephony service are:
Option A: Information transfer with max delay in the order of hundreds of milliseconds, extremely low jitter; bit rate in the order of tens of kbit/s; error probability not exceeding a few percent.
Option B: Max delay in the order of tens of seconds; negligible error probability.
Option C: Max delay in the order of hundreds of milliseconds; bit rate in the order of tens of Mbit/s.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: Voice is sensitive to delay (must be < 150-400ms for interactivity) and jitter (variation in delay). However, human hearing is tolerant of some data loss (packet loss/errors), so perfect reliability isn't strictly required. The bandwidth requirement for standard voice (PCM) is 64 kbit/s, or less with compression.
Question 75
Question: In original IP routing (without masks/classes), the choice of the output interface to forward a packet is based on:
Option A: The full IP address (net_id + host_id) of the recipient.
Option B: The subnet/network part (net_id) of the recipient's IP address.
Option C: Only the host part (host_id) of the recipient's IP address.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: Standard IP routing scales because routers do not know the location of every single host. They only know how to reach networks. The router looks at the Destination IP, extracts the Network ID (using the class or mask), and matches it against its routing table entries to find the next hop.
Question 76
Question: The DNS (Domain Name Service):
Option A: Uses caches to increase speed, but every resolution must always reach the authoritative server.
Option B: Is used by operators to sell domain names.
Option C: Is based on a system of hierarchical servers, each responsible for the naming of a particular zone.
Option D: Is a product for load balancing routers.
Correct Answer: C
Motivation: DNS is a distributed, hierarchical database. No single server has all data. The hierarchy consists of Root servers -> TLD servers (com, org) -> Authoritative servers (example.com). Each server is responsible (authoritative) only for its specific zone. Caching (Option A is false because of this) allows skipping the full hierarchy lookup for recently accessed names.
Question 77
Question: Which of the following statements comparing Aloha and Slotted-Aloha protocols is FALSE?
Option A: Slotted-Aloha allows better exploitation of transmission medium capacity.
Option B: Aloha performance is less dependent on propagation delays compared to Slotted-Aloha.
Option C: Aloha is simpler to implement as it does not require slot synchronization.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: Option A is true (Slotted Aloha doubles efficiency, 0.368 vs 0.184). Option C is true (No sync needed for Pure Aloha). Option B is false because both are sensitive to propagation delays, but Slotted Aloha typically requires the slot size to be larger than the propagation delay + transmission time to function correctly globally, making it technically more dependent on knowing the max propagation delay to define the slot size correctly.
Question 78
Question: In the case of packet switching:
Option A: Resources are allocated to users to establish a circuit; resources must be released if needed by others.
Option B: Resources are allocated exclusively; resources are released only at the end.
Option C: The switching function does not allocate resources exclusively to users; network resources are always available for packet transmission; packets wait in queues for resources to become available.
Correct Answer: C
Motivation: This is the definition of statistical multiplexing in packet switching. There is no dedicated physical path (circuit). Bandwidth is shared dynamically. If traffic exceeds capacity temporarily, packets are buffered (queued) rather than blocked (as in circuit switching), leading to variable delays.
Question 79
Question: In the UDP header (PCI of UDP), which of the following are obligatorily contained?
Option A: The TTL (Time To Live) field.
Option B: The source and destination port.
Option C: The source and destination IP address.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: UDP provides process-to-process communication. To do this, it needs Ports.
      * TTL and IP addresses are in the IP Header.
      * Ports are in the UDP Header.
Question 80
Question: Routing tables in the Internet:
Option A: Indicate the full sequence of routers to traverse.
Option B: Indicate only the next router (next hop) to traverse to reach the destination.
Option C: Indicate the sequence of autonomous systems.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: IP routing is "hop-by-hop". A router does not know the full path to the destination. It only knows which directly connected neighbor (Next Hop) is the correct step towards that destination network.
Question 81
Question: Data transfer between two application processes in the OSI model occurs involving:
Option A: Only two application entities.
Option B: At least one entity for each of the seven layers in both systems.
Option C: One entity in each system, independent of the layer.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: Logical communication happens peer-to-peer (App to App). However, actual physical data transfer requires the data to pass down through the encapsulation stack (Layers 7 to 1) at the sender, travel across the medium, and pass up the stack (Layers 1 to 7) at the receiver. Thus, entities at all layers are involved in processing the data.
Question 82
Question: Consider two Ethernet LANs A and B, connected by a Switch B1 and a Router R1 (in parallel). If a host on LAN A transmits an ARP packet to get the MAC address of Router R1:
Option A: The packet is forwarded to LAN B only by Router R1.
Option B: The packet is forwarded to LAN B only by Switch B1.
Option C: Forwarded by either based on MAC.
Option D: Forwarded by both.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation:
      1. Router R1: Routers do not forward broadcast traffic (like ARP Requests) between subnets. R1 will receive the ARP request (since it's the target), process it, and reply directly. It will not flood it to LAN B.
      2. Switch B1: Switches forward broadcasts (FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF) out of all ports except the receiving one. Therefore, B1 will forward the ARP packet to LAN B.
Question 83
Question: The SMTP protocol:
Option A: Operates on UDP.
Option B: Always includes encrypted authentication.
Option C: Is used for the delivery of outgoing email messages from a client to a server (and between servers).
Option D: Is used to transfer emails from server to client.
Correct Answer: C
Motivation: SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is a "Push" protocol used to send mail from a client (User Agent) to a server, and to relay mail between servers (MTA to MTA). Retrieving mail from a server to a client uses "Pull" protocols like POP3 or IMAP. SMTP uses TCP, not UDP.
Question 84
Question: Using a Stop-And-Wait protocol on a non-sequential channel (where packets can arrive out of order):
Option A: Is always handled without problems.
Option B: Can give rise to protocol malfunctions, causing information loss or algorithm blocking.
Option C: Causes malfunctions but not blocking.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: Stop-and-Wait typically uses a 1-bit sequence number (0, 1). If the channel is non-sequential (packets can be delayed significantly and arrive much later), an old packet "0" might arrive when the receiver is expecting a new packet "0". The receiver cannot distinguish between them, accepts the duplicate as new data, and data corruption occurs.
Question 85
Question: An (N-1)-protocol allows interaction:
Option A: Between an (N+1)-entity and an (N-1)-entity.
Option B: Between two (N-1)-entities.
Option C: Between two entities regardless of level.
Option D: Between two (N)-entities.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: A protocol is strictly defined as a set of rules governing the communication between peer entities at the same layer. An (N-1)-protocol governs the conversation between an (N-1)-entity on System A and an (N-1)-entity on System B.
Question 86
Question: In the case of Circuit Switching:
Option A: Resources are shared dynamically.
Option B: The switching function allocates a subset of network resources to users for exclusive use; resources are released only at the end of communication.
Option C: Resources are not allocated exclusively.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: Circuit switching (like the old telephone network) establishes a dedicated physical path (circuit) for the duration of the call. Bandwidth is reserved. Even if no one speaks (silence), the capacity is occupied and cannot be used by others until the circuit is torn down (hang up).
Question 87
Question: IPv4 Class C addresses characterize:
Option A: Multicast communications.
Option B: (Few) networks with a large number of hosts.
Option C: (Many) networks with a small number of hosts.
Option D: Broadcast communications.
Correct Answer: C
Motivation: A Class C address has 24 bits for the Network ID and 8 bits for the Host ID.
      * The large Network ID space ($2^{21}$) allows for many networks.
      * The small Host ID space ($2^8 - 2 = 254$) allows for a small number of hosts per network.
Question 88
Question: CSMA and CSMA-CA protocols:
Option A: Try to avoid interference via preventive listening (Carrier Sense); transmission begins only if the channel is heard free.
Option B: Do not implement preventive control.
Option C: Listen, and transmission begins only if the channel is effectively free (guaranteed).
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: CSMA stands for Carrier Sense Multiple Access. The core logic is "Listen Before Talk". If the medium is busy, the node waits. This reduces collisions significantly compared to Aloha, although it doesn't eliminate them (due to propagation delay or hidden terminals).
Question 89
Question: "Signaling" refers to:
Option A: Transfer of information.
Option B: The exchange of information regarding the control of a telecommunications network.
Option C: Interconnection of resources.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: In telecoms, "Signaling" is the exchange of control messages needed to set up, manage, and tear down calls or connections (e.g., dialing a number, routing lookup messages, busy signals). It is distinct from the actual user data/voice transfer.
Question 90
Question: The MIME protocol allows:
Option A: Having data encoded in different ways (non-text) inside an email message.
Option B: Reserving network resources.
Option C: Monitoring transmission quality.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: SMTP was originally text-only (7-bit ASCII). MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) extends email to support:
      * Text in character sets other than ASCII.
      * Non-text attachments (images, audio, video).
      * Multipart message bodies.
Question 91
Question: Statistical Multiplexing means:
Option A: Fixed frequency multiplexing.
Option B: Random choice between frequency and time multiplexing.
Option C: A multiplexing schema that does not foresee a predetermined assignment of transmission resources to information flows.
Correct Answer: C
Motivation: In statistical multiplexing (used in packet switching), link bandwidth is shared on demand. There are no fixed time slots or frequency bands assigned to users. Users compete for bandwidth; if a user has nothing to send, they consume 0 resources, allowing others to use the full capacity. It relies on the statistical probability that not all users will transmit at peak rates simultaneously.
Question 92
Question: What is the order of magnitude of the maximum transmission speed on an optical fiber?
Option A: 1 Tbit/s (Terabit/s)
Option B: 1 kbit/s
Option C: 1 Mbit/s
Option D: 1 Gbit/s
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: Modern optical fiber systems using WDM (Wavelength Division Multiplexing) can reach aggregate speeds in the Terabits per second range (e.g., 400 Gbps or 800 Gbps per wavelength, with dozens of wavelengths per fiber).
Question 93
Question: If a router receives a correct TCP packet, encapsulated in an IP packet, destined for a non-existent TCP port (for which no application process is waiting):
Option A: It discards it and sends an ICMP packet to the destination.
Option B: Passes it to a default process.
Option C: Ignores the TCP port value and forwards the packet.
Option D: Discards it and sends an ICMP packet to the source.
Correct Answer: C
Motivation: A Router's job is to forward IP packets based on the Destination IP. It generally operates at Layer 3. It does not look at Layer 4 (TCP ports) unless it is the final destination or acting as a firewall/NAT. Therefore, if the packet is just passing through, the router ignores the port and routes the packet normally. Note: If the router WAS the destination, Option D (ICMP Port Unreachable) would be correct, but the context implies a transit router.
Question 94
Question: The increment of the TCP transmitter's current window ($cwnd$):
Option A: Is regulated only by the receiver.
Option B: Is regulated only by the slow-start phase.
Option C: Is regulated by the congestion control phases called slow-start and congestion avoidance.
Correct Answer: C
Motivation: The Congestion Window ($cwnd$) is dynamic.
      * In Slow Start, it increases exponentially (double every RTT).
      * In Congestion Avoidance, it increases linearly (+1 MSS every RTT).
The actual transmission window is $\min(cwnd, rwnd)$, but the increment logic of the congestion component depends on both phases.
Question 95
Question: CSMA and CSMA-CD protocols admit 1-persistent and non-persistent versions:
Option A: In the case of the 1-persistent version, if sensing the channel indicates it is busy, the station continues to listen and starts transmitting as soon as the current transmission ends. In the case of non-persistent versions, if sensing the channel indicates it is busy, the transmission attempt is rescheduled after a random delay.
Option B: In the non-persistent version, if the channel is busy, the attempt is postponed by a random delay; in the 1-persistent version, if busy, transmission begins as soon as the channel becomes free.
Option C: In both cases, random delay is used.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation:
         * 1-persistent: "I'm persistent." If busy, wait and listen continuously. As soon as it's free, transmit immediately (Probability = 1). High collision risk if multiple nodes are waiting.
         * Non-persistent: "I'm chill." If busy, don't keep listening. Wait a random amount of time, then check again. Reduces collisions but increases latency.
Question 96
Question: Assume that between a transmitter and receiver using a Go-Back-N ARQ scheme, the time between the start of transmission of a data unit and the end of reception of the corresponding ACK is constant and greater than the time needed to transmit the full window. In this situation, increasing the transmission speed on the links:
Option A: Decreases the average information transferred per unit time.
Option B: Does not increase the average information transferred.
Option C: Increases the average information transferred per unit time.
Correct Answer: C
Motivation: If the window is "full" (transmission time of window < RTT), the transmitter goes idle waiting for ACKs. The bottleneck is the window size limit, not the link speed. Increasing link speed reduces the time to send the bits ($T_x$), but since we are already blocked by the window limit/RTT, we spend more time idle. While the throughput (bits/sec) technically increases slightly because the active bursts are faster, the efficiency drops drastically. However, technically, transmitting faster always increases throughput unless the processing/propagation completely dominates, but usually "Increases" is the accepted answer in simple models because you clear the buffer faster. Correction based on Italian logic: The standard quiz logic often argues that if you are window-limited, increasing line speed doesn't help linear throughput proportionally (efficiency drops), but physically, sending bits faster usually results in higher throughput (C).
Question 97
Question: In the OSI model, frame delimitation (identifying the end of a packet) is a function:
Option A: Performed by all layers.
Option B: Typical of the layer or sublayer adjacent to the physical layer.
Option C: Exclusive to the network layer.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: Framing is a Data Link Layer (Layer 2) function. It turns the raw stream of bits from the Physical Layer into discrete "Frames". This is done using flags, byte counts, or physical layer coding violations.
Question 98
Question: In case of segment loss identified by the reception of three duplicate ACKs, the size of the TCP Reno transmitter window:
Option A: Is brought to half the receiver window.
Option B: Is brought back to the initial value (1 segment).
Option C: Is set to half the current value (specifically half + 3 segments for Fast Recovery).
Correct Answer: C
Motivation: This is the Fast Recovery mechanism in TCP Reno. Receiving 3 duplicate ACKs indicates a specific packet loss, not severe congestion (since other packets are getting through). Instead of dropping to Slow Start (1 segment), Reno halves the Congestion Window ($cwnd = cwnd / 2$) and enters Congestion Avoidance/Fast Recovery to maintain high throughput.
Question 99
Question: Frame Relay technology involves:
Option A: Transfer of fixed-size data units connectionless.
Option B: Transfer of fixed-size data units on virtual circuits.
Option C: Transfer of variable-size data units on virtual circuits.
Correct Answer: C
Motivation: Frame Relay is a streamlined packet-switching protocol.
         * It uses Virtual Circuits (DLCI identifiers).
         * It handles Frames (Variable size), unlike ATM which uses Cells (Fixed size).
Question 100
Question: The Network Address Translation (NAT) mechanism:
Option A: Realizes OSI mapping between Layer 3 and Layer 2 addresses.
Option B: Can modify the IP addresses of packets.
Option C: Associates a host's logical address to an IP address.
Option D: Modifies the packet path on the Internet.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: The primary function of a NAT device (router) is to rewrite the IP header. It replaces the Source IP (private IP) of outgoing packets with its own Public IP. It also modifies the Source Port (PAT) to track connections. This allows multiple private hosts to share a single public IP.
Question 101
Question: In the absence of other packets, the minimum time required for a packet to traverse a switch operating in store-and-forward mode:
Option A: Increases as the packet transmission speed increases.
Option B: Increases as the distance between the source and destination of the packet increases.
Option C: Increases as the number of bits composing the packet increases.
Correct Answer: C
Motivation: In store-and-forward switching, the entire packet must be received (stored) before it can be processed and forwarded. This reception time (serialization delay) is directly proportional to the packet size ($L$) and inversely proportional to the transmission rate ($R$). Therefore, larger packets (more bits) take longer to "store," increasing the minimum traversal time.
Question 102
Question: The application program PING:
Option A: Uses ICMP protocol messages to determine the path followed to reach an Internet host.
Option B: Uses a TCP protocol option to verify the connectivity of an Internet host.
Option C: Uses ICMP protocol messages to verify the connectivity of an Internet host.
Correct Answer: C
Motivation: PING uses ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) "Echo Request" and "Echo Reply" messages. Its primary purpose is to verify reachability (connectivity) and measure round-trip time. Path determination (traceroute) uses similar messages but manipulating TTL; PING specifically tests connectivity.
Question 103
Question: Given a network topology with N nodes and M unidirectional channels, where each channel has capacity C Mbit/s and the routing algorithm distributes traffic uniformly. If the average number of channels traversed by a packet (average path length, D) decreases, the maximum quantity of traffic handled by the network:
Option A: Decreases C, given constant N, M, D.
Option B: Decreases M, given constant N, D, C.
Option C: Decreases D, given constant N, M, C.
Option D: Decreases N, given constant D, M, C.
Correct Answer: C
Motivation: The total network capacity is essentially the sum of all link capacities divided by the average number of times a packet consumes a link (hops). If the average path length ($D$) decreases, each packet uses fewer network resources. Consequently, the network can accommodate more simultaneous packets, increasing the total throughput. (Note: The option phrasing "Decreases D..." describes the condition that causes the increase, matching the question stem).
Question 104
Question: Statistical multiplexing:
Option A: Can be used only in connectionless networks.
Option B: Is used in telephone networks because it is strictly associated with the use of constant speed channels.
Option C: Consists of sharing a single resource (transmission channel, memory device, etc.) among traffic sources that use it based on instantaneous needs.
Option D: Can be used only in connection-oriented networks, but not circuit-switched ones.
Correct Answer: C
Motivation: Statistical multiplexing allocates resources dynamically on demand rather than reserving them statically (as in Time Division Multiplexing). It relies on the statistical probability that not all users will burst data at the same time, allowing for more efficient use of shared bandwidth.
Question 105
Question: In a packet-switched network operating in store-and-forward mode, a larger data unit size:
Option A: Increases the complexity of routing each data unit.
Option B: Increases the time that elapses from when a data unit reaches the input of a switch to when it leaves the switch.
Option C: Increases the number of operations that must be performed by a switch to transfer the same total amount of user information.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: As established in Question 101, store-and-forward requires the full packet to be received before forwarding. Larger packets mean longer serialization delays at every hop. Therefore, the latency (store time) per switch increases with packet size.
Question 106
Question: Congestion control in the TCP protocol:
Option A: Is not available.
Option B: Occurs with duplicate ACKs and upon timeout expiration.
Option C: Is based on the signaling by the receiver of the available reception window.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: TCP infers congestion from packet loss. Loss is detected in two main ways: the expiration of the Retransmission Timer (Timeout), which usually implies severe congestion, or the reception of 3 Duplicate ACKs (indicating a gap in sequence), which triggers Fast Retransmit/Fast Recovery. Option C refers to Flow Control, not Congestion Control.
Question 107
Question: Window protocols are also called ARQ (Automatic Retransmission reQuest) because:
Option A: In case of arrival of an erroneous packet, the receiver requests retransmission.
Option B: In case of missing ACK return, the receiver requests retransmission.
Option C: The expiration of the timeout at the transmitter corresponds to an automatic request for retransmission.
Correct Answer: C
Motivation: The "Request" in ARQ is implicit. The transmitter automatically assumes a packet is lost if it doesn't receive an acknowledgment within a specific time (Timeout) and "requests" itself to retransmit. It doesn't necessarily rely on an explicit NACK message from the receiver (though some variants might use them); the core mechanism is the automatic timeout-based retransmission.
Question 108
Question: In the case of common channel signaling:
Option A: Each channel for user information transfer corresponds to a signaling channel.
Option B: A single signaling channel is used to control numerous channels transferring user information; the signaling channel operates in packet mode.
Option C: A single signaling channel is used to control numerous channels transferring user information; the signaling channel operates in circuit mode.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: Common Channel Signaling (CCS), such as SS7, separates signaling from the voice/data path. A dedicated high-speed packet-switched network handles the signaling for a large number of voice circuits (trunks), improving efficiency and call setup times compared to channel-associated signaling.
Question 109
Question: At the current state of technology, it is possible to transmit information without amplification along the transmission path over greater distances using:
Option A: The Hertzian channel (radio, satellite).
Option B: Optical fibers.
Option C: Telephone twisted pairs.
Option D: Coaxial cables.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: Deep space probes (Voyager) and satellites communicate over thousands or millions of kilometers without intermediate repeaters (amplifiers) in the medium (space). While the signal attenuates ($1/d^2$), high-gain antennas and sensitive receivers allow basic communication over vast distances that guided media (fiber, copper) cannot match without regeneration/amplification every 50-100 km.
Question 110
Question: The (N+1)-directory function associates:
Option A: An (N+1)-address to an (N)-address.
Option B: An (N+1)-title to an (N)-address.
Option C: An (N+1)-title to an (N+2)-address.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: In OSI naming conventions, a "Title" identifies an entity globally (like a name), while an "Address" identifies where it is attached (location). The directory service at layer N helps map the logical name (Title) of an entity at layer N+1 to the address at layer N required to reach it.
Question 111
Question: The preamble placed before IEEE 802.3 (Ethernet) data units is necessary to:
Option A: Allow keeping the network synchronous.
Option B: Allow synchronization of repeaters and receivers encountered on the local network.
Option C: Allow repeaters to retransmit data units at the same speed they were received.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: The Ethernet preamble consists of 7 bytes of alternating 1s and 0s (10101010). This pattern allows the receiver's physical layer circuitry (PLL - Phase Locked Loop) to lock onto the incoming bit stream's clock (synchronization) before the actual data frame begins.
Question 112
Question: If a router detects an incorrect checksum on an IP packet, and thus a potential error on the IP addresses contained in the packet, during the routing phase:
Option A: It discards it and sends an ICMP packet only to the source.
Option B: It discards it and sends an ICMP packet to both the source and destination.
Option C: It discards it without signaling it to any other network entity.
Option D: It forwards it anyway to the destination, sending an ICMP packet to the source to signal the error.
Correct Answer: C
Motivation: If the IP header checksum fails, the router cannot trust any field in the header, including the Source IP address. Sending an error message (ICMP) to a potentially corrupted source address could cause broadcast storms or send errors to the wrong host. Therefore, the standard behavior is to silently drop the packet.
Question 113
Question: In the OSI model, which of the following functions is performed by Session layer entities?
Option A: Routing of data units in a not fully connected topology.
Option B: Choosing data representation syntax for a work session.
Option C: Definition of synchronization points in a data unit flow.
Correct Answer: C
Motivation: The Session Layer (Layer 5) manages the dialogue between applications. One of its specific features is inserting "synchronization points" (checkpoints) into the data stream. If a connection fails, the session can be resumed from the last confirmed checkpoint rather than starting from the beginning.
Question 114
Question: The complexity of routing procedures used within a node to forward information has the greatest influence on network performance in the case of:
Option A: Packet switching without virtual circuits (datagram mode).
Option B: Packet switching with virtual circuits.
Option C: Circuit switching.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: In datagram networks (like standard IP), every single packet requires a routing table lookup to determine the next hop. This per-packet processing is computationally intensive. In virtual circuit or circuit switching, the complex routing decision happens only once during setup; subsequent data forwarding is done via simple label swapping or time-slot mapping, which is much faster.
Question 115
Question: The LLC SNAP (SubNetwork Access Protocol) format of the IEEE 802.2 LLC protocol:
Option A: Allows sharing a broadcast transmission medium.
Option B: Allows the coexistence of a large number of protocols higher than layer 2.
Option C: Is required in the Internet for data unit transfer in subnets.
Option D: Guarantees transmission error recognition.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: The standard 802.2 LLC header has limited space for identifying the upper-layer protocol (DSAP/SSAP fields are only 1 byte). SNAP extends this header to include a 5-byte Protocol ID (EtherType), allowing Ethernet to support many different protocols (IPv4, IPv6, IPX, ARP, etc.) simultaneously on the same link.
Question 116
Question: In CSMA and CSMA-CD protocols, the concept of "persistence" refers to:
Option A: The mode in which the transmission attempt occurs if the channel listening indicates it is busy.
Option B: The calculation of the time for which a station is authorized to occupy the channel.
Option C: The mode in which the retransmission attempt occurs if a collision has occurred.
Option D: The time during which two transmissions overlap on the channel.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: Persistence strategies define what a node does immediately after sensing a busy channel.
         * 1-persistent: Transmit as soon as it becomes free.
         * Non-persistent: Wait a random time before sensing again.
         * p-persistent: Transmit with probability $p$ when free.
Option C refers to "Backoff" after a collision, which is different.
Question 117
Question: In the IP header (the PCI of the IP protocol), are contained:
Option A: The 16-bit Checksum field for checking the correctness of the header and the data contained in the packet.
Option B: The Sequence Number field for segment numbering.
Option C: The Identification and Fragment Offset fields that allow packet fragmentation management.
Correct Answer: C
Motivation: The IP header contains specific fields to handle fragmentation: Identification (to group fragments of the same packet), Flags (MF - More Fragments), and Fragment Offset (position of the fragment). Option A is false because the checksum covers only the header. Option B is false because Sequence Numbers belong to TCP (Transport Layer).
Question 118
Question: Why does VDSL technology have high performance only if the distance between the street cabinet and the user's home is less than a hundred meters?
Option A: Because the end-to-end delay between the user's home and the operator's central office is reduced.
Option B: Because cable laying costs are reduced.
Option C: Because the shorter copper cable length allows the use of modulation at a higher bit rate (higher frequencies).
Option D: Because connections must cross fewer intermediate nodes.
Correct Answer: C
Motivation: Copper wires suffer from attenuation that increases significantly with frequency and distance. VDSL operates at very high frequencies (up to 30 MHz or more) to achieve high speeds. These high frequencies attenuate very quickly. Therefore, the copper loop must be very short (FTTC - Fiber to the Cabinet) to ensure the signal remains strong enough to carry data at those rates.
Question 119
Question: The PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol) does not use address fields because:
Option A: It exploits underlying MAC addresses.
Option B: It exploits upper layer addresses.
Option C: It must operate on point-to-point links.
Option D: It has no space in the frame header.
Correct Answer: C
Motivation: In a true point-to-point link, there is only one sender and one receiver. Once a frame is put on the wire, it can only go to the other end. Therefore, a destination address is redundant and technically unnecessary (though PPP framing often includes a dummy address byte 0xFF for HDLC compatibility).
Question 120
Question: The DHCP protocol provides that:
Option A: A client uses an IP address as soon as it receives it in a DHCP Offer message.
Option B: A client can disconnect from the network without communicating it to the server.
Option C: If a server exists, it is unique in the client's local network.
Option D: The server never provides the IP address of a DNS server in its response.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: While there is a DHCPRELEASE message, it is not mandatory for a client to send it when shutting down or disconnecting. The server relies on the "Lease Time"; if the client effectively disappears, the lease will eventually expire, and the IP will be reclaimed. Option A is false (Client must Request and get Ack first). Option C is false (redundancy is common).
Question 121
Question: The fundamental functions of the Data Link layer in the OSI model are:
Option A: Flow control and recovery of transmission errors.
Option B: Routing of data units.
Option C: Transfer of binary digits on the channel.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: The Data Link layer is responsible for reliable node-to-node transfer. This involves Error Control (detecting and often correcting errors via CRCs and retransmissions) and Flow Control (preventing a fast sender from overwhelming a slow receiver on the same link). Routing (B) is Layer 3; Bit transfer (C) is Layer 1.
Question 122
Question: During the slow-start phase of TCP congestion control, the transmitter's current window:
Option A: Is halved for every missing acknowledgment (ACK).
Option B: Grows by one segment for every acknowledgment (ACK) received.
Option C: Doubles for every acknowledgment (ACK) received.
Option D: Remains constant over time.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: In Slow Start, for every ACK received, the Congestion Window ($cwnd$) increases by 1 MSS. Since a window of size $N$ produces $N$ ACKs in one RTT, the window size effectively doubles every Round Trip Time (1 $\to$ 2 $\to$ 4 $\to$ 8). The per-ACK growth is linear (+1), which results in exponential growth over time.
Question 123
Question: What is the order of magnitude of the maximum transmission speed on coaxial cable?
Option A: 1 Tbit/s
Option B: 1 Mbit/s
Option C: 1 bit/s
Option D: 1 kbit/s
Option E: 1 Gbit/s
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: Note on source ambiguity: The source marks "1 Mbit/s" as correct but mentions "hundreds of Mbit/s" in the comment. Historically, early Ethernet on coax (10Base5) was 10 Mbit/s. Modern Coax (DOCSIS for Cable TV internet) reaches Gigabits per second. However, in the context of legacy comparison with fiber (Tbps) and twisted pair (Mbps/Gbps), the quiz likely references older baseband coax standards or a specific scale context. Based on the provided key, B is the selected answer, likely referring to the baseline standard Ethernet speeds (10 Mbps) being closer to the "Mbit" order than the "Tbit" order.
Question 124
Question: Window protocols can be used:
Option A: Only for communications that use a connection.
Option B: For both communications that use a connection and those that do not.
Option C: Only for communications that do not use a connection.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: Window protocols (like Go-Back-N or Selective Repeat) rely on state synchronization between sender and receiver (sequence numbers, window state). This state maintenance implies a logical connection. You cannot track sequence numbers or acknowledgments reliably in a stateless, purely connectionless flow without establishing a context (connection) first.
Question 125
Question: The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP):
Option A: Allows obtaining an Ethernet address to assign to the card of the machine making the ARP request.
Option B: Allows a host to know the IP address of its DNS server.
Option C: Realizes OSI mapping (translation) between (3)-addresses and (2)-addresses.
Correct Answer: C
Motivation: ARP maps a Layer 3 (Network) address (specifically IPv4) to a Layer 2 (Data Link) address (MAC address). It allows a device to find the hardware address needed to send a frame to a local IP destination.
Question 126
Question: In the OSI model, segmentation performed by an entity of layer (N+1):
Option A: Creates many (N+1)-PDUs starting from a single (N+1)-SDU.
Option B: Creates one (N+1)-PDU starting from many (N)-SDUs.
Option C: Groups many (N+1)-PDUs into a single (N)-SDU.
Option D: Creates many (N+1)-PCIs for the same (N+1)-PDU.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: Segmentation is the process of splitting a large data block into smaller chunks. An entity at layer N+1 takes the data unit from the layer above (SDU) and, if it's too large for the protocol or the layer below, splits it into multiple Protocol Data Units (PDUs) of layer N+1.
Question 127
Question: Let $W_T > 1$ and $W_R > 1$ be the dimensions of transmission and reception windows respectively. Let N be the total quantity of sequence numbers. Which constraint is necessary and sufficient to avoid malfunctions on a non-inverting channel?
Option A: $N = W_T + 1$
Option B: $N = (W_T + W_R) / 2$
Option C: $N = W_R + 1$
Option D: $N \ge W_T + W_R$
Correct Answer: D
Motivation: To ensure correct operation (specifically for Selective Repeat), the sequence number space ($N$) must be large enough so that there is no overlap between the current receiving window and the range of packets that might be retransmitted from the previous window. The limit is $N \ge W_T + W_R$. For Go-Back-N ($W_R=1$), this simplifies to $N \ge W_T + 1$.
Question 128
Question: The three fundamental elements that define a protocol are:
Option A: Algorithms, formats, timing.
Option B: Algorithms, formats, entities.
Option C: Algorithms, services, timing.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: The standard definition of a protocol includes:
            1. Syntax (Formats): Data structure and encoding.
            2. Semantics (Algorithms/Rules): Control information, coordination, and error handling.
            3. Timing (Synchronization): Speed matching and sequencing of events.
Question 129
Question: An Ethernet card of a Bridge reads and decides if and how to route:
Option A: All packets, regardless of the destination address.
Option B: Only packets with unicast destination MAC matching the bridge.
Option C: Only broadcast packets.
Option D: Only multicast packets.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: A Bridge (or Switch) operates in "promiscuous mode" at the hardware level. It captures every frame on the wire to check its Source MAC (for learning) and its Destination MAC (for forwarding/filtering decisions). It doesn't just look at frames addressed to itself.
Question 130
Question: Which of the following statements is FALSE?
Option A: An IP router can use ARP to know the MAC address of the next hop.
Option B: A host can use ICMP to verify connectivity.
Option C: A router that does not perform NAT does not modify the IP addresses of packets.
Option D: An IP host always performs only direct deliveries.
Correct Answer: D
Motivation: An IP host performs direct delivery only if the destination is on the same local subnet. If the destination is remote (different subnet), the host performs indirect delivery by sending the packet to its Default Gateway (Router). Therefore, statement D is false.
Question 131
Question: To avoid blocking or loss of data units in a window protocol due to non-sequential channels, it is useful to:
Option A: Number PDUs on >1 bit and not limit lifetime.
Option B: Number PDUs on a number of bits greater than 1 and limit the lifetime of PDUs in the network.
Option C: Number PDUs on a single bit and limit lifetime.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: On a non-sequential channel (where packets can arrive out of order or be delayed significantly), an old duplicate packet could reappear and be accepted as new if the sequence numbers wrap around too quickly. To prevent this:
            1. Use a large sequence space (many bits).
            2. Enforce a Maximum Segment Lifetime (TTL) to ensure old packets die before their sequence numbers are reused.
Question 132
Question: The constraints on the maximum extension of an IEEE 802.3 (CSMA/CD) local network derive from:
Option A: Both the signal propagation delay from one end of the network to the other, and signal attenuation on transmission media.
Option B: Only attenuation.
Option C: Bit count needed.
Option D: Limited Layer 3 addresses.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: The maximum length is limited by:
            1. Physics (Attenuation): The signal degrades over distance (e.g., 100m for UTP, 500m for Thick Coax).
            2. MAC Protocol (Collision Detection): The round-trip propagation delay must be less than the time it takes to transmit the smallest frame (Slot Time). If the cable is too long, a sender might finish transmitting before detecting a collision that occurred at the far end, breaking the CSMA/CD logic.
Question 133
Question: In the case where a window protocol is used on a sequential channel (no reordering), assuming non-cyclic progressive numbering, the transmission and reception windows can NEVER be in the following situation:
Option A: No sequence number in the reception window is included in the transmission window.
Option B: The smallest sequence number in the transmission window is smaller than the smallest in the reception window.
Option C: The smallest sequence number in the reception window is smaller than the smallest sequence number in the transmission window.
Option D: The largest number in Rx is larger than the largest in Tx.
Correct Answer: C
Motivation: The receiver's window advances only when it receives correct, in-order packets from the transmitter. Therefore, the receiver can never be "behind" the transmitter's completed packets. The transmitter window starts at the oldest unacknowledged packet. The receiver window starts at the packet it is waiting for. Since the packet must be sent before it is received, the Receiver's "Left Edge" (expected packet) is always $\ge$ Transmitter's "Left Edge" (oldest unacked). It's impossible for the Receiver to be waiting for packet $X$ if the Transmitter has already marked $X$ as acknowledged and moved past it.
Question 134
Question: MAC (Medium Access Control) sublayer protocols have the purpose:
Option A: To allow sharing of a broadcast channel through a distributed algorithm.
Option B: To allow sharing of a broadcast channel through a centralized algorithm.
Option C: To allow sharing of a point-to-point channel.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: The primary goal of MAC protocols in LANs (like Ethernet/CSMA) is to coordinate access to a shared (broadcast) medium where multiple nodes contend for bandwidth. The "Distributed" nature is key: there is no central master; every node follows the same rules (e.g., Listen before talk) to avoid collisions.
Question 135
Question: The IEEE 802.3 (CSMA/CD) standard provides for data units (including layer 2 headers):
Option A: Variable size between 10 and 4500 octets.
Option B: Variable size between 64 and 1518 octets.
Option C: Fixed size equal to 53 octets.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: Ethernet frames have strict size limits:
            * Minimum: 64 bytes (required for collision detection timing).
            * Maximum: 1518 bytes (payload of 1500 MTU + 18 bytes header/trailer).
(Note: Modern "Jumbo Frames" allow more, but the standard definition is 64-1518).
Question 136
Question: Which of the following statements is true?
Option A: In the commercial Ethernet standard (CSMA/CD access protocols), a minimum packet size was defined to ensure correct collision identification
Option B: n the commercial Ethernet standard (CSMA/CD access protocol), a minimum packet size was defined to distinguish packets from those of the IEEE 802.3 standard.
Option C: In the commercial Ethernet standard (CSMA/CD access protocol), a minimum packet size was defined to guarantee better performance, in terms of throughput, for the access protocol compared to what would be obtained with maximum size packets.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: This reinforces Question 132/135. The minimum frame size ensures that the transmission time ($T_{trans}$) is longer than the Round Trip Time ($RTT$) of the network. If a frame were smaller than this, a collision could occur at the far end of the cable, but the sender would stop transmitting before the collision signal (jam) propagates back, leading the sender to falsely believe the transmission was successful.
Question 137
Question: In the TCP header (PCI of TCP), are obligatorily contained:
Option A: TTL Field.
Option B: The sequence number and the ack number, for segment and acknowledgment numbering.
Option C: The fragmentation field.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: TCP provides reliable, ordered delivery. This is achieved using Sequence Numbers (to order packets and detect duplicates) and Acknowledgment Numbers (to confirm receipt). These are the core fields of the TCP header. TTL and Fragmentation are IP (Layer 3) concepts.
Question 138
Question: A protocol:
Option A: Is a set of semantic and syntactic rules to allow communication between two peer entities.
Option B: Is a set of rules for entities of the same system.
Option C: Is a set of rules for connecting two systems.
Option D: Is a set of rules for entities of different systems (regardless of layer).
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: The standard definition emphasizes "Peer Entities" (same layer, different systems). A protocol defines the language (syntax) and meaning (semantics) of the messages exchanged between these corresponding layers to achieve a service.
Question 139
Question: In a Store-and-Forward packet network, increasing the number of nodes between source and destination:
Option A: Leads to an increase in delivery time, directly proportional to the packet size.
Option B: Leads to an increase in delivery time, proportional to average speed.
Option C: Leads to an increase in delivery time, inversely proportional to packet size.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: Each "hop" (node traversal) adds a transmission delay equal to $L/R$ (Packet Size / Rate). If you add $N$ nodes, you add $N \times (L/R)$ to the total latency. Thus, the extra delay scales linearly with the packet size $L$.
Question 140
Question: The UDP protocol provides a service:
Option A: Unreliable (no delivery guarantee) and connectionless.
Option B: Reliable and connectionless.
Option C: Unreliable and connection oriented.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: UDP is the "bare minimum" transport. It fires and forgets packets (Connectionless) and does not verify if they arrive (Unreliable).
Question 141
Question: The TCP protocol provides a service:
Option A: Unreliable and connectionless.
Option B: Reliable and connectionless.
Option C: Unreliable and connection oriented.
Option D: Reliable (with delivery guarantee) and connection oriented.
Correct Answer: D
Motivation: TCP is designed to provide a reliable byte stream. It establishes a session (Connection Oriented via 3-way handshake) and guarantees data arrives intact, in order, and without duplicates (Reliable) using ACKs and retransmissions.
Question 142
Question: The PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol):
Option A: Uses the byte-stuffing technique to guarantee data transparency.
Option B: Uses bit-stuffing.
Option C: Does not guarantee data transparency.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: PPP is byte-oriented. It uses the flag 0x7E. If the data payload contains 0x7E, PPP inserts a specific "Control Escape" byte (0x7D) before it and XORs the data byte. This is called Byte Stuffing (or Character Stuffing). (HDLC uses bit-stuffing, PPP uses byte-stuffing).
Question 143
Question: Comparing Fast Ethernet at 100 Mb/s (100Base-T) with Ethernet at 10 Mb/s, which statement is FALSE?
Option A: Distance constraints between nodes are tighter.
Option B: A different access protocol is used.
Option C: A different physical layer is used.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: This is the key "False" statement. Fast Ethernet intentionally kept the same access protocol (CSMA/CD) to ensure backward compatibility and ease of evolution. It did change the Physical Layer (new signaling, fiber/twisted pair requirements) and distance constraints (reduced collision domain), but the MAC logic remained identical.
Question 144
Question: Which of the following protocols does NOT realize error detection functions on data units?
Option A: LaPB.
Option B: IEEE 802.2 LLC (Logical Link Control).
Option C: PPP.
Option D: LaPF.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: Error detection (CRC) is typically done at the MAC sublayer (in the 802.3 frame trailer) or by the HDLC/PPP framing. The LLC sublayer (802.2), which sits inside the MAC data field, assumes the underlying MAC has already checked for errors. Therefore, the LLC header itself does not usually include a CRC for the data.
Question 145
Question: Which of the following statements is true regarding topology performance?
Option A: A topology $T_1$, with $N$ nodes, $C$ channels, and average distance $M_1$, is always able to handle less traffic than a topology $T_2$, with $N$ nodes, $C$ channels, and average distance $M_2 > M_1$, only when traffic is uniformly distributed among nodes.
Option B: A topology $T_1$, with $N$ nodes, $C$ channels, and average distance $M_1$, is always able to handle less traffic than a topology $T_2$, with $N$ nodes, $C$ channels, and average distance $M_2 > M_1$, regardless of the traffic distribution.
Option C: The amount of traffic handled in a topology $T_1$, with $N$ nodes, $C$ channels, and average distance $M_1$, compared to that handled in a topology $T_2$, with $N$ nodes, $C$ channels, and average distance $M_2 > M_1$, depends on the traffic distribution among the nodes.
Correct Answer: C
Motivation: You cannot declare one topology strictly "better" than another without knowing the traffic pattern. For example, a Ring topology might be efficient for neighbor-to-neighbor traffic but poor for cross-network traffic compared to a Star. A specialized traffic matrix can favor one topology over another despite average distance metrics.
Question 146
Question: Among the main differences between a Frame Relay network and an IP Internet network are:
Option A: Use of ARQ.
Option B: Information transfer in connection-oriented mode instead of connectionless mode.
Option C: Variable size units.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: Frame Relay is a Virtual Circuit technology (Connection-Oriented). Before sending data, a path (DLCI) is established. IP is Datagram (Connectionless); packets are sent without setup. (Note: Both use variable length packets/frames, and modern Frame Relay often drops ARQ inside the network for speed, so B is the distinct structural difference).
Question 147
Question: Consider an Ethernet LAN with 10 nodes. Partition the network into two networks interconnected by transparent bridges. Which statement is FALSE?
Option A: The bridge separates collision domains.
Option B: Network performance in terms of handled traffic improves in any traffic condition, i.e., completely independent of traffic distribution among nodes.
Option C: The bridge introduces additional delay.
Option D: It is not necessary to modify node configuration.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: Bridges improve performance only if the traffic is localized. If 100% of the traffic is from Side A to Side B, the bridge becomes a bottleneck (all traffic must pass through it), and performance is limited by the bridge's throughput, potentially being worse than or equal to a shared bus, plus latency. Improvements rely on statistical separation of traffic.
Question 148
Question: Consider two LANs A and B, connected by a bridge B1 and a router R1 in parallel. A host on A transmits an IP packet to a host on B.
Option A: The packet is forwarded to LAN B by either the bridge or the router, depending on the destination MAC address contained in the packet.
Option B: Forwarded by both.
Option C: Forwarded only by Router.
Option D: Forwarded only by Bridge.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation:
               1. Scenario 1 (Same Subnet): If Host A thinks Host B is on the same subnet, it ARPs for Host B's MAC. The Bridge learns this and forwards the frame directly to B. Dest MAC = Host B. Router ignores it.
               2. Scenario 2 (Different Subnet): If Host A thinks Host B is remote, it sends the frame to the Default Gateway (Router R1). Dest MAC = Router R1. The Bridge forwards this frame to the Router's port (or filters if local). The Router then routes it.
So, strictly speaking, who actively forwards the IP packet logically depends on addressing, but physically, the frame handling depends on the MAC. If the Destination MAC is the Router, the Router handles it. If the Destination MAC is the Host B, the Bridge passes it. The answer A captures this dependency on the Layer 2 addressing choice made by the sender.
Question 149
Question: The size of the TCP transmitter's current window during a connection:
Option A: Is regulated exclusively by receiver signaling (Flow Control).
Option B: Varies with network congestion variation and flow control exercised by the receiver.
Option C: Is fixed.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: The effective Transmission Window is the minimum of two values: the Receive Window ($rwnd$, Flow Control) and the Congestion Window ($cwnd$, Congestion Control). Therefore, it varies based on both the receiver's buffer capacity and the network's traffic conditions.
Question 150
Question: In case of segment loss identified by receiving three duplicate ACKs, the size of the TCP Reno transmitter window:
Option A: Is brought to a value equal to half the threshold.
Option B: Is brought to a value equal to the threshold value.
Option C: Is returned to the initial value.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: Congestion avoidance, half of cwnd 
Question 151
Question: What is the order of magnitude of the maximum transmission speed on a twisted pair cable?
Option A: 1 Tbit/s
Option B: 1 kbit/s
Option C: 1 Mbit/s
Option D: 1 Gbit/s
Correct Answer: D
Motivation: Modern twisted pair standards (like Cat5e, Cat6, Cat6a) support speeds of 1 Gbit/s (1000BASE-T) and up to 10 Gbit/s (10GBASE-T) over short distances. Even higher speeds (40 Gbps) are possible over very short runs (Cat8), making the "Gigabit" order the correct current benchmark.
Question 152
Question: An IP Router:
Option A: Performs both fragmentation and reassembly of the datagram.
Option B: Performs fragmentation of datagrams, but not reassembly.
Option C: Does not perform fragmentation of datagrams.
Option D: Performs fragmentation of datagrams, and reassembly only if an appropriate bit is set in the IP header.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: Routers may fragment IPv4 packets if the outgoing link MTU is smaller than the packet size. However, they never reassemble fragments. Reassembly is computationally expensive and requires buffering; therefore, it is always performed only by the final destination host. (Note: IPv6 routers do not fragment at all).
Question 153
Question: Common Channel Signaling:
Option A: Requires the use of signaling messages containing the identifier of the connection to which they refer.
Option B: Is used only in packet-switched networks, because channel-associated signaling is used in circuit-switched networks.
Option C: Cannot be used in cell or packet switching networks because it is too difficult to identify connections.
Option D: Uses common transmission channels that are associated with each connection during the opening phase.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: Since signaling travels on a separate, shared channel (Common Channel) distinct from the user data voice path, the signaling messages must explicitly carry a "Connection Identifier" (or Circuit Identification Code - CIC) to tell the switches which specific voice circuit/trunk the command (e.g., "Setup call") applies to.
Question 154
Question: Code Division Multiplexing (CDMA):
Option A: Is a special case of time division only.
Option B: Is a special case of frequency division only.
Option C: Allows using multiplexing and switching on the same physical medium.
Option D: Does not necessarily require being coupled with time or frequency multiplexing.
Correct Answer: D
Motivation: CDMA is a distinct multiplexing technique based on orthogonal codes (Spread Spectrum). Unlike TDM (Time) or FDM (Frequency), it allows users to transmit at the same time and on the same frequency, separated only by their unique mathematical codes. It stands independently of TDM and FDM.
Question 155
Question: An (N)-protocol regulates interactions:
Option A: Between an (N)-entity and an (N-1)-SAP.
Option B: Between (N)-entities of the same system or different systems.
Option C: Between an (N)-entity and all entities below it.
Option D: Between an (N)-entity and the (N-1)-entity.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: A protocol is strictly defined as the rules governing communication between peer entities (entities at the same layer $N$). These entities are usually on different systems (communicating hosts), but the definition covers peer-to-peer logic. Interactions between different layers ($N$ and $N-1$) are defined by interfaces and services, not protocols.
Question 156
Question: A Go-Back-N window protocol provides that:
Option A: When a packet is received with an error, the last N data units are retransmitted.
Option B: The transmitter receives acknowledgments for the last N data units transmitted before starting transmission of other data units.
Option C: The transmitter cannot send more than N data units before having received one or more acknowledgments.
Option D: Whenever a timeout expires, the data unit whose sequence order is equal to the sequence number of the last transmitted data unit minus N is retransmitted.
Correct Answer: C
Motivation: This is the definition of the transmission window. The window size ($W_T = N$) represents the maximum number of unacknowledged packets allowed "in flight". Once the transmitter sends $N$ packets without receiving an ACK, it blocks/stops until an ACK arrives, sliding the window forward.
Question 157
Question: Which of these statements regarding HTTP is false?
Option A: HTTP is an application layer protocol that allows transferring objects of a web page.
Option B: HTTP is a language that allows defining the format of Web pages.
Option C: HTTP is based on a client-server architecture.
Option D: Without additional solutions, HTTP is a stateless protocol.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is the transport mechanism for fetching web resources. HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the language used to define the format and structure of web pages. HTTP carries HTML, but it is not a markup language itself.
Question 158
Question: Using the piggybacking technique in window protocols achieves the advantage of:
Option A: Confirming through a single acknowledgment the reception of more than one data unit.
Option B: Transmitting data units even outside the transmission window.
Option C: Increasing the probability that an ACK is received by the transmitter.
Option D: Reducing the percentage of control information transported in the network.
Correct Answer: D
Motivation: Piggybacking attaches the Acknowledgment (control info) to an outgoing Data packet (user info) instead of sending a separate, standalone ACK packet. This reduces the overhead (headers, framing) associated with generating separate control packets, thereby reducing the ratio of control bits to total bits on the network.
Question 159
Question: The DHCP Discover message is sent via UDP using as IP destination address:
Option A: The limited broadcast IP address 255.255.255.255.
Option B: The loopback address 127.0.0.1.
Option C: The IP address of the local DNS server.
Option D: The IP address of the DHCP server on the local network.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: When a client first joins a network, it does not have an IP address and does not know the IP address of the DHCP server. Therefore, it must shout "Is there a DHCP server here?" to everyone. The destination IP 255.255.255.255 is the "Limited Broadcast" address, ensuring the packet is delivered to all hosts on the local link (and usually not forwarded by routers).
Question 160
Question: What disadvantage does datagram packet switching present compared to circuit switching?
Option A: Variability of data delays.
Option B: Routing calculation at the source.
Option C: Routing calculation at communication opening.
Option D: High communication opening time.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: In circuit switching, resources are reserved, guaranteeing constant bit rate and minimal, constant delay. In datagram packet switching, packets share resources dynamically (statistical multiplexing) and are queued in buffers at each router. Queue sizes fluctuate with traffic load, causing variable delays (jitter) for each packet.
Question 161
Question: In the absence of errors, the efficiency of a Stop and Wait protocol:
Option A: Is always superior to the efficiency of a Go-Back-N protocol.
Option B: Is inferior to the efficiency of a Go-Back-N protocol only if the transmission time of a packet plus the round trip time on the channel is lower than the time needed to send the entire transmission window of the Stop and Wait protocol.
Option C: Is inferior to the efficiency of a Go-Back-N protocol only if the transmission time of a packet is higher than the round trip propagation time.
Option D: Is always inferior (or equal) to the efficiency of a Go-Back-N protocol.
Correct Answer: D
Motivation: Stop-and-Wait is essentially Go-Back-N with a window size of $N=1$. Since Go-Back-N allows $N \ge 1$, Stop-and-Wait is the worst-case scenario of Go-Back-N efficiency. Go-Back-N allows pipelining (sending multiple packets during the RTT), whereas Stop-and-Wait forces idle time every RTT. Thus, Stop-and-Wait is always less efficient (or equal, if Go-Back-N also used $N=1$).
Question 162
Question: What is the playout buffer used for?
Option A: To access multimedia content more quickly thanks to local caching.
Option B: To avoid congestion situations in the network.
Option C: To compensate for network delays (jitter) in streaming multimedia content.
Option D: To manage the retransmission window for multimedia content.
Correct Answer: C
Motivation: In streaming (VoIP or video), packets arrive with variable delays (jitter). A playout buffer stores incoming packets and plays them out at a steady, constant rate. It artificially delays the playback slightly to ensure that even packets arriving late have time to get into the buffer before they are needed, smoothing out the jitter.
Question 163
Question: In a virtual circuit packet switching network, the number of labels used for routing is proportional to:
Option A: The number of possible destinations.
Option B: The average number of output channels from each node.
Option C: The number of active connections.
Option D: The average number of nodes to traverse.
Correct Answer: C
Motivation: In Virtual Circuit (VC) networks (like ATM or Frame Relay), each active communication session is assigned a unique local identifier (Label/VCI). The switches maintain a table mapping these labels. Therefore, the table size and label usage scale with the number of concurrent active connections (flows), not with the total network size or possible destinations.
Question 164
Question: How are ARP protocol messages encapsulated?
Option A: In the body of an HTTP message.
Option B: Directly in an Ethernet frame.
Option C: In one or more TCP segments.
Option D: Directly in an IP datagram.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) works below the IP layer to resolve Layer 3 addresses to Layer 2 addresses. It does not use IP headers. Instead, ARP packets are encapsulated directly into Layer 2 frames (like Ethernet) with a specific EtherType (0x0806) to identify them.
Question 165
Question: What happens when the TCP transmission timeout is set to a value significantly lower than the round-trip time?
Option A: Unnecessary segment retransmissions may occur.
Option B: The time needed to recover from segment loss situations lengthens.
Option C: There is never any visible effect.
Option D: The receiver no longer guarantees correct data to the listening socket.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: If the Timeout < RTT, the sender will "time out" and mistakenly assume a packet is lost before the ACK has even had a chance to return. This causes the sender to retransmit the packet unnecessarily (spurious retransmission), wasting bandwidth and potentially confusing the congestion control (forcing it to slow down incorrectly).
Question 166
Question: The instability of Aloha and Slotted Aloha protocols is caused by:
Option A: The increase in propagation delay when offered traffic exceeds a certain threshold.
Option B: The decrease in handled traffic (throughput) when offered traffic exceeds a certain threshold.
Option C: The increase in handled traffic when offered traffic exceeds a certain threshold.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: In Aloha, as more users try to transmit (Offered Load increases), collisions increase. Beyond a certain point ($G=0.5$ for Aloha, $G=1$ for Slotted), the collisions become so frequent that successful throughput drops. This drop causes more retransmissions, which increases load further, causing even lower throughput—a feedback loop leading to network collapse (instability/saturation at 0 throughput).
Question 167
Question: Consider a host transmitting data using TCP. Given a current transmitter window ($cwnd$) of 10 segments and a receiver max window ($rwnd$) of 40 segments. When the transmitter receives a segment containing an ACK, which situation is IMPOSSIBLE?
Option A: Current transmitter window becomes 1 segment.
Option B: Current transmitter window becomes 51 segments.
Option C: Current transmitter window becomes 9 segments.
Option D: Current transmitter window becomes 5 segments.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: The effective transmission window is constrained by $\min(cwnd, rwnd)$. Here, $rwnd=40$. Even if $cwnd$ grows, the effective window cannot exceed the receiver's advertised limit significantly in a single step, and certainly, the $cwnd$ itself grows incrementally (Slow Start +1, or Congestion Avoidance +1/cwnd). Jumping to 51 (implies huge jump or violation of $rwnd$ logic) is impossible in standard TCP dynamics from a state of 10. A drop (A, C, D) is possible due to timeout or 3-dup ACKs (halving).
Question 168
Question: Which of these fields is NOT contained in an IPv4 datagram header?
Option A: Destination IP address.
Option B: Time to live (TTL).
Option C: Protocol.
Option D: Destination port.
Correct Answer: D
Motivation: The Destination Port is used to identify the specific application/process receiving the data. This is a function of the Transport Layer, so it is found in the TCP or UDP header, not the IP (Network Layer) header. IP only cares about getting the packet to the correct host (IP Address).
Question 169
Question: In the DNS hierarchy for resolving names not in cache, which level is immediately below the Root DNS Server?
Option A: Top-level domain (TLD) DNS server.
Option B: Local DHCP server.
Option C: Local DNS server.
Option D: Authoritative DNS server.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: The DNS hierarchy starts at the Root (.). Below the Root are the Top-Level Domains (TLD) like .com, .org, .it. Below TLDs are the Authoritative servers for specific domains (e.g., https://www.google.com/search?q=google.com). When resolving, the Root server directs the query to the appropriate TLD server.
Question 170
Question: The TCP congestion window ($cwnd$) at the beginning of the connection:
Option A: Has dimension negotiated with the receiver and equal to half the receiver window.
Option B: Has dimension equal to one maximum segment size (MSS) (or a small constant like 2-4 MSS).
Option C: Has dimension negotiated with the receiver and equal to the max receiver window.
Option D: Has a random dimension.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: TCP starts conservatively to avoid overwhelming the network immediately ("Slow Start"). Traditionally, it initializes the Congestion Window to 1 MSS (modern implementations use 2, 4, or 10 MSS, but conceptually it starts "small" and fixed, not negotiated). The Receiver Window ($rwnd$) is negotiated/advertised, but $cwnd$ is a local sender variable.
Question 171
Question: In a packet-switched network operating in store-and-forward mode, a smaller data unit size:
Option A: Decreases the number of operations performed by a switch.
Option B: Increases the probability of losing the packet.
Option C: Decreases routing complexity.
Option D: Decreases the time that elapses from when a data unit reaches the input of a switch to when it leaves the switch.
Correct Answer: D
Motivation: Smaller packets have lower serialization delay ($L/R$). In store-and-forward, the switch must wait for the full packet to arrive before forwarding. Reducing the packet size reduces this waiting time at every hop, thus reducing the per-hop latency (Store time).
Question 172
Question: In a unidirectional ring topology with 10 nodes and uniform unicast traffic (all nodes transmit same amount to all others), the average number of channels traversed by a packet is:
Option A: 20
Option B: 10
Option C: 5
Option D: 1
Correct Answer: C
Motivation: In a unidirectional ring of $N$ nodes, the distance to other nodes ranges from 1 hop (neighbor) to $N-1$ hops (the node just behind). The average distance is the average of numbers $1$ to $N-1$, which is roughly $N/2$. For $N=10$, average $\approx 5$. (Precise math: $\frac{1+2+...+9}{9} = \frac{45}{9} = 5$).
Question 173
Question: Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) congestion control is based on:
Option A: Variation of parity bits.
Option B: Segment size trend.
Option C: Adaptation of sender window to receiver memory.
Option D: The dynamics of the transmitter window dimension ($cwnd$).
Correct Answer: D
Motivation: TCP regulates the rate at which it injects packets into the network by dynamically adjusting the size of its Congestion Window ($cwnd$). It probes bandwidth by increasing $cwnd$ (Slow Start/Congestion Avoidance) and backs off when it infers congestion (Packet Loss), effectively using the window size as the throttle.
Question 174
Question: The minimum time necessary to send a 100 Kbyte packet between two stations separated by 300 meters, using UTP cabling and traversing 3 switching devices operating in store and forward mode, is in the order of:
Option A: Some seconds.
Option B: Can only be calculated knowing the transmission bit rate on the channels.
Option C: A few milliseconds.
Option D: Hundreds of milliseconds.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: The total delay is the sum of Propagation Delay ($D_{prop} \approx \text{distance}/speed\_of\_light$, negligible for 300m) and Transmission Delay ($D_{trans} = \text{PacketSize} / \text{BitRate}$). Since there are 3 store-and-forward devices (plus source), the packet is serialized 4 times. Without knowing the Bit Rate (bandwidth), it is impossible to calculate $D_{trans}$, which is the dominant factor here.
Question 175
Question: What are the source and destination port fields used for in TCP and UDP?
Option A: To implement a multiplexing/demultiplexing mechanism for processes on hosts.
Option B: To manage resource allocation on the router.
Option C: To indicate network interfaces.
Option D: To indicate physical interfaces.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: Ports identify specific Application Processes (sockets) running on a host. They allow the Transport Layer to accept data from multiple apps (Multiplexing) and deliver incoming data to the correct app (Demultiplexing) based on the port number.
Question 176
Question: Among the fundamental functions of the transport layer in the OSI model we find:
Option A: Label swapping.
Option B: Reading data from a peripheral.
Option C: Transmission error recovery.
Option D: Routing of data units.
Correct Answer: C
Motivation: The Transport Layer (specifically connection-oriented protocols like TCP) is responsible for Reliability. It ensures end-to-end data integrity by detecting lost or corrupted packets (using checksums and sequence numbers) and recovering them via retransmissions (ARQ). Routing is Layer 3; Label swapping is Layer 2/2.5.
Question 177
Question: Assuming equal information rate transmitted, which of the following line encodings requires a lower bitrate at the physical layer?
Option A: 12B15B coding.
Option B: 4B5B coding.
Option C: They all require the same bit rate.
Option D: 8B10B coding.
Correct Answer: C
Motivation:
                  * 4B5B: Efficiency 4/5 = 80%. Overhead 25%.
                  * 8B10B: Efficiency 8/10 = 80%. Overhead 25%.
                  * 12B15B: Efficiency 12/15 = 4/5 = 80%. Overhead 25%.
Since they all have the same ratio of data bits to total bits (efficiency), they all require the same physical line rate to support a given user data rate.
Question 178
Question: If a router receives an IP packet with correct checksum, same source and destination IP address, and $TTL=9$:
Option A: It routes it towards the destination.
Option B: Forwards it but sends ICMP.
Option C: Discards and sends ICMP.
Option D: Discards the packet.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: This is the "Land Attack" scenario logic, but strictly speaking, a router's job is to forward packets. If the checksum is good and TTL > 0 (which 9 is), the router simply looks up the destination in its table and forwards it. A standard router doesn't usually check if Source == Destination (unless it has specific firewall rules). It just forwards. The destination host is responsible for handling the loopback logic.
Question 179
Question: The preamble in the Ethernet packet:
Option A: Allows recognizing transmission errors.
Option B: Allows identifying the protocol type.
Option C: Allows identifying the application process.
Option D: Is necessary to allow the receiver node to synchronize its clock with the transmitter's clock.
Correct Answer: D
Motivation: The preamble is a pattern of alternating 1s and 0s (10101010...) sent at the start of the frame. It gives the receiver's hardware time to "wake up" and lock its Phase Locked Loop (PLL) to the incoming signal frequency (Bit Synchronization) before the actual frame data begins.
Question 180
Question: Two IP stations configured with IPs 130.192.40.1/24 and 130.192.40.200/24:
Option A: Do not have valid IP addresses.
Option B: Can exchange IP packets directly.
Option C: Can exchange IP packets only via a router.
Option D: Cannot exchange IP packets.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation:
Since the Network IDs (first 3 bytes) are equal, the hosts are on the same subnet. Therefore, they can communicate directly (Layer 2); otherwise they must send traffic to a Default Gateway (Router) to be routed between the networks. 
Question 181
Question: SMTP:
Option A: Is used by a mail client to fetch a message from a server.
Option B: Allows a mail server to communicate to another mail server who is the sender of a message.
Option C: Allows a server to verify user identity.
Option D: Is based on telnet.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: SMTP is a "Push" protocol used for Server-to-Server relaying. When Server A sends mail to Server B, it uses SMTP to identify the sender (MAIL FROM:) and recipients (RCPT TO:). (Option A describes POP3/IMAP).
Question 182
Question: TCP messages contain a sequence number that indicates:
Option A: The next byte the receiver expects.
Option B: The message number in the sequence.
Option C: Fragment number.
Option D: The position of the first byte of the message (segment) in the sequence of bytes transmitted on the TCP connection.
Correct Answer: D
Motivation: TCP is a byte-stream protocol, not packet-stream. Sequence numbers count bytes, not packets. The Sequence Number field in the header identifies the index of the first payload byte in that specific segment within the overall data stream.
Question 183
Question: Congestion control in TCP:
Option A: Imposes a max number of connections.
Option B: Relies on router info.
Option C: Is present only for some connections.
Option D: Limits the size of the transmission window.
Correct Answer: D
Motivation: As established in Q173, TCP controls congestion by throttling the sender. It does this by bounding the amount of unacknowledged data using the Congestion Window ($cwnd$). Reducing $cwnd$ effectively slows down the transmission rate.
Question 184
Question: In the WI-FI protocol with DCF and handshaking:
Option A: Sending RTS and CTS packets reduces the probability of collisions on data packets.
Option B: Collisions are completely avoided.
Option C: Allows hidden terminals to transmit simultaneously.
Option D: Avoids collisions on any data type.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: RTS (Request to Send) and CTS (Clear to Send) reserve the channel before the large Data packet is sent. If a collision occurs, it happens on the small RTS packet (cheap to retransmit). Once CTS is received, the channel is reserved, protecting the large Data packet from hidden node collisions. It reduces probability/impact, but doesn't eliminate collisions on the RTS itself.
Question 185
Question: The HEAD method of the HTTP protocol is used to:
Option A: Get the header of a web page.
Option B: Send only the header of a request.
Option C: Modify the header.
Option D: Receive only the header of the HTTP response.
Correct Answer: D
Motivation: HEAD is identical to GET, except the server must not return a message body. It returns only the status line and header section (meta-information like Content-Length, Type, Last-Modified). It is useful for checking link validity or caching status without downloading the full content.
Question 186
Question: The reception on node A of an ICMP Echo Reply packet sent by node B indicates that:
Option A: A and B are capable of exchanging IP packets.
Option B: A can send to B but not vice versa.
Option C: B can send to A but not vice versa.
Option D: B can send to A but vice versa is not guaranteed.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: A successful PING (Echo Request + Echo Reply) proves bidirectional connectivity.
                        1. A's Request reached B (Forward path works).
                        2. B processed it and sent a Reply.
                        3. B's Reply reached A (Return path works).
Thus, both A and B can successfully exchange IP packets.
Question 187
Question: The ARP Request frame is used to learn:
Option A: MAC of a remote station.
Option B: IP of a local node.
Option C: IP given name.
Option D: The MAC address of an IP node directly connected to the source node (same subnet).
Correct Answer: D
Motivation: ARP is a broadcast protocol used on the local link. It asks "Who has IP X?" to find the physical MAC address of a neighbor. It cannot resolve MACs for remote nodes (routers answer for them) or find IPs from names (that's DNS).
Question 188
Question: The DHCP protocol:
Option A: Is used for the automatic configuration of an IP station.
Option B: Provides only private IPs.
Option C: Provides IP for a domain name.
Option D: Does not allow reuse of IPs.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) automates the assignment of network parameters. It provides the IP address, Subnet Mask, Default Gateway, and DNS servers to a client, removing the need for manual static configuration.
Question 189
Question: Given a topology (nodes, channels, costs), the optimal path between a source and destination:
Option A: Never changes if a channel fails.
Option B: Changes depending on the node executing the algorithm.
Option C: Is the same whether using a link state algorithm or a distance vector algorithm.
Option D: Never changes if costs change.
Correct Answer: C
Motivation: Both Link State (Dijkstra) and Distance Vector (Bellman-Ford) algorithms are designed to find the Shortest Path (least cost) on a graph. Given the same graph and same link costs, the mathematical "shortest path" is unique (or has equal cost alternatives). Both algorithms will converge to the same optimal route.
Question 190
Question: When an Ethernet switch receives an ARP Request packet:
Option A: Forwards only to DHCP server.
Option B: Forwards it on all ports except the one from which the packet was received.
Option C: Forwards only on multicast ports.
Option D: Forwards only to destination.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: An ARP Request is sent to the Broadcast MAC Address (FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF). By definition, a switch floods broadcast frames out of all interfaces (except the ingress interface) to ensure the destination, wherever it is, receives it.
Question 191
Question: IPv4 addresses are:
Option A: Assigned randomly.
Option B: Assigned by card manufacturers.
Option C: Generally assigned on a geographical and topological basis, to favor aggregability.
Correct Answer: C
Motivation: To keep global routing tables manageable (prevent explosion), IP addresses are allocated hierarchically (IANA -> RIR -> ISP -> Customer). This allows "Route Aggregation" (CIDR), where one route summary (e.g., 100.0.0.0/8) covers millions of hosts in a specific region (topology), rather than having random scattered IPs everywhere.
Question 192
Question: The slow start phase in TCP:
Option A: Keeps window low forever.
Option B: Is for flow control.
Option C: Allows the congestion window to grow quickly (exponentially) starting from a very low initial value.
Option D: Allows slow growth.
Correct Answer: C
Motivation: Despite the name "Slow Start", the window growth is aggressive (Exponential). It starts "Slow" (Low value, e.g., 1 MSS) but doubles every RTT ($1, 2, 4, 8...$) to quickly ramp up and find the available bandwidth capacity of the network.
Question 193
Question: The minimum packet size in the Ethernet CSMA/CD protocol:
Option A: Is necessary to guarantee collision recognition.
Option B: Is for performance maximization.
Option C: Avoids consecutive collisions.
Option D: Does not depend on network size.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: Reinforcing Q136: The packet transmission time must be longer than the network round-trip time ($Slot Time$). If a packet is too short, the sender stops transmitting before the collision signal returns, leading to undetected packet loss. The 64-byte minimum ensures the sender is still "on the wire" when the collision notification arrives.
Question 194
Question: A ring topology might be preferable to a mesh topology because:
Option A: Carries voice and data.
Option B: Routing is simpler.
Option C: Is more robust.
Option D: Bidirectional paths.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: In a ring, routing is trivial: just send the packet to the next neighbor. There is no complex decision-making or table lookup required. A mesh requires complex routing algorithms (Dijkstra/Bellman-Ford) to calculate paths. (Note: Mesh is usually more robust; Ring is simpler).
Question 195
Question: Two stations in the same collision domain in an Ethernet network:
Option A: Can collide only if exactly simultaneous.
Option B: Never collide due to CSMA.
Option C: Identify collision via NACK.
Option D: Can create a collision when they transmit a packet.
Correct Answer: D
Motivation: Even with Carrier Sense (CSMA), collisions occur. If two nodes sense the channel is free and decide to transmit at nearly the same time (within the propagation delay window), their signals will overlap and garble (collide). Being in the same collision domain defines this possibility.
Question 196
Question: TCP segments sent from host A to host B contain an Acknowledgment number that indicates:
Option A: The next byte B expects.
Option B: The next byte host A expects to receive in segments sent by host B.
Option C: Segment position.
Option D: First byte position.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: The ACK number in TCP header is valid for the Reverse direction. If A sends a packet to B with ACK = X, A is telling B: "I have received everything up to X-1. The next byte I expect to receive from you (B) is X."
Question 197
Question: A node using a Selective Repeat window protocol with cumulative ACK semantics receives a duplicate PDU. Assuming no data was lost, what is the most likely cause?
Option A: Receiver window too small.
Option B: The transmitter timeout is too short (premature timeout).
Option C: Timeout too long.
Option D: Transmitter window too small.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: If the transmitter's timeout is shorter than the actual Round Trip Time (RTT), the transmitter will "give up" waiting for the ACK too soon and retransmit the packet. The receiver, having already received the first copy (and sent an ACK that is still in flight), receives the second copy as a duplicate.
Question 198
Question: A node using a Go-Back-N window protocol with cumulative ACK semantics receives a duplicate PDU. What action does it take?
Option A: Always sends an ACK related to the expected sequence number.
Option B: Sends ACK of duplicate.
Option C: Sends ACK only if timeout not expired.
Option D: Sends ACK of duplicate.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: In Go-Back-N, the receiver discards out-of-order or duplicate packets. However, it must signal the sender what it actually needs to keep the window moving or correct the sender. Therefore, it sends an ACK for the Next Expected Sequence Number (Cumulative ACK). If it receives a duplicate $X$ while waiting for $Y$, it sends ACK $Y$ again (forcing the sender to realize it needs to send $Y$).
Question 199
Question: The IP protocol:
Option A: Implements Transport layer.
Option B: Makes a large network more scalable thanks to address aggregability.
Option C: Used in LANs because Ethernet is adequate.
Option D: Provides access mechanisms.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: IP's hierarchical addressing (Network/Host) and CIDR allow for Route Aggregation. Routers in the core of the Internet don't need to know every single subnet; they route based on large aggregated blocks. This scalability is the key reason IP can support a global network of billions of devices.
Question 200
Question: A routing protocol:
Option A: Provides exchange of information on network state to build routing tables.
Option B: Defines operations to forward single packets.
Option C: Defines operations to choose the path towards the destination.
Option D: Uses routing tables only for circuit switching.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: Routing protocols (like OSPF, RIP, BGP) are the control-plane mechanisms. They involve routers exchanging information (Link States, Distance Vectors) to dynamically build and maintain the Routing Table (RIB). This table is then used to compute the best paths.
Question 201
Question: In the ATM protocol of the B-ISDN network, data units, called cells, are small in size (48 bytes + 5 bytes header) in order to:
Option A: Segment IP protocol data units into cells to decrease data loss probability.
Option B: Improve the ratio between headers and user data in the cell.
Option C: Reduce packetization delay (packet creation time) to transfer voice for real-time applications.
Option D: Increase the transfer speed of a large file thanks to the efficient segmentation and reassembly process.
Correct Answer: C
Motivation: ATM was designed to handle both voice and data. For real-time voice traffic, large packets introduce significant latency (packetization delay) because the system must wait to fill the packet before sending. Small, fixed-size cells (53 bytes) minimize this delay, ensuring low latency crucial for voice calls, while still supporting high-speed data.
Question 202
Question: The DNS (Domain Name System):
Option A: Is a system used for the automatic configuration of the domain name on Internet hosts.
Option B: Is a distributed database that, given a search key, allows locating a record of a specified type within a hierarchy of servers.
Option C: Is a system used by IANA to delegate the assignment of domain names (Top Level Domain).
Option D: Is a server installed within a corporate network containing the correspondence between name and address of any Internet host.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: DNS is not a single server but a globally distributed, hierarchical database system. It maps hostnames (search keys) to IP addresses (and other resource records) by querying a tree of servers (Root, TLD, Authoritative) rather than keeping a centralized list of all Internet hosts.
Question 203
Question: The simultaneous sharing of the same physical channel among different sources can occur:
Option A: Through frequency multiplexing (FDM).
Option B: Through circuit multiplexing.
Option C: Through circuit switching.
Option D: Through virtual circuit packet switching.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM) divides the available bandwidth of a physical medium into distinct frequency sub-bands (channels). This allows multiple signals to be transmitted simultaneously over the same medium without interfering with each other, as each occupies a different part of the spectrum.
Question 204
Question: To an Ethernet network containing 200 stations, the following IP network can be assigned:
Option A: 130.192.2.0/24
Option B: 130.192.0.0/25
Option C: 130.192.2.0/25
Option D: 130.192.2.0/26
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: You need a subnet capable of hosting 200 distinct nodes.
                           * /24 provides $2^8 - 2 = 254$ hosts. (Sufficient).
                           * /25 provides $2^7 - 2 = 126$ hosts. (Insufficient).
                           * /26 provides $2^6 - 2 = 62$ hosts. (Insufficient).
Therefore, the /24 subnet is the only one large enough.
Question 205
Question: TCP segments:
Option A: Have a fixed size negotiated at connection setup.
Option B: Have a fixed size specified by the TCP standard.
Option C: Have a variable size decided based on the network congestion level.
Option D: Have a variable size that does not depend on the network congestion level.
Correct Answer: D
Motivation: TCP segment size is variable, up to a limit called MSS (Maximum Segment Size), which is determined by the MTU of the links (Path MTU Discovery) or local interface limits. While congestion control affects the number of segments sent (Window Size), it does not typically alter the size of individual segments dynamically to fight congestion; the size is primarily an efficiency/fragmentation concern.
Question 206
Question: To reduce packetization delay, it is advisable to:
Option A: Increase the header size.
Option B: Choose a nearby destination.
Option C: Reduce the size of the PDU data field.
Option D: Use a contention access protocol.
Correct Answer: C
Motivation: Packetization delay is the time required to fill a packet's payload with data (e.g., waiting for a voice codec to generate enough bits). By reducing the size of the data field (payload), the packet can be filled and sent sooner, thus reducing the delay. This is why ATM uses small cells.
Question 207
Question: In a UTP (Unshielded Twisted Pair) cable, signal transmission occurs by exploiting:
Option A: The difference between voltages of different pairs of conductors.
Option B: The difference between the voltages on the components of a pair of conductors.
Option C: The difference between the voltage of a single conductor and "ground".
Option D: The difference between the voltage of a single conductor and the metal shield.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: UTP uses differential signaling. The receiver detects the voltage difference between the two wires twisted together in a single pair. This technique makes the signal highly immune to external electromagnetic interference (noise), as noise tends to affect both wires equally and is cancelled out when taking the difference.
Question 209
Question: Flow control:
Option A: Is offered by UDP using a specific field in the header.
Option B: Is offered by both TCP and UDP as it is fundamental for end-to-end communication.
Option C: Is not offered by either TCP or UDP as it is already present in lower layer protocols.
Option D: Is offered by TCP using a specific field in the header.
Correct Answer: D
Motivation: Flow control is a mechanism to prevent a fast sender from overwhelming a slow receiver. TCP implements this using the Receive Window (rwnd) field in its header, where the receiver advertises its available buffer space. UDP is a simple, unreliable protocol and does not implement flow control.
Question 210
Question: An example of multiple access is represented by:
Option A: Base station transmitting towards mobile terminals of a cellular network.
Option B: Fixed telephony local exchange.
Option C: Television transmissions radiated by satellite.
Option D: Mobile terminals transmitting towards a base station in a cellular network.
Correct Answer: D
Motivation: Multiple Access (the "MA" in CSMA, CDMA, FDMA) refers to a scenario where multiple distinct transmitters compete to send data onto a single shared medium or receiver (the Base Station). Option A is "Broadcasting" (One to Many). Option D is the classic "Many to One" multiple access scenario.
Question 211
Question: Which of the following functions is NOT performed by the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)?
Option A: Congestion Control.
Option B: Maintenance of byte sequence.
Option C: Multiplexing/demultiplexing through the port mechanism.
Option D: Choice of packet routing.
Correct Answer: D
Motivation: Routing (choosing the path through the network) is the specific responsibility of the Network Layer (IP). TCP (Transport Layer) runs only on the end hosts and cares about reliable delivery, ordering, and flow/congestion control, but it has no knowledge of the network topology or routers.
Question 212
Question: For a transmitter implementing an ARQ (Automatic Retransmission reQuest) scheme, the reception of a succession of acknowledgments containing the same sequence number is a symptom of:
Option A: An increase in timeout duration.
Option B: A loss of acknowledgment data units (ACKs).
Option C: An increase in available bandwidth between transmitter and receiver.
Option D: A loss of an information data unit.
Correct Answer: D
Motivation: In protocols like TCP, receiving "Duplicate ACKs" (e.g., three ACKs all requesting packet $N$) indicates that the receiver is getting subsequent packets ($N+1, N+2...$) but is still missing packet $N$. This implies that packet $N$ was lost in transit (Fast Retransmit logic).
Question 213
Question: Which of the following functions is NOT characteristic of the second architectural layer (Data Link) of the OSI model?
Option A: Data unit delimitation (Framing).
Option B: Addressing on the local network.
Option C: Error control on data units.
Option D: End-to-end routing of data units.
Correct Answer: D
Motivation: Layer 2 (Data Link) handles delivery within a single local network segment (hop-to-hop). End-to-end routing across multiple networks is the definition of Layer 3 (Network) functions.
Question 214
Question: Which of the following statements applies to Fast Ethernet in full-duplex mode?
Option A: Full-duplex mode can be used between a user station and a switch port, or between the ports of two switches.
Option B: Full-duplex mode does not allow a greater distance between a user station and a switch.
Option C: Full-duplex mode allows interconnecting switches in a ring topology.
Option D: Full-duplex mode does not increase the amount of information handled between a user station and a switch compared to half-duplex.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: Full-duplex disables CSMA/CD and allows simultaneous transmission and reception. This requires a point-to-point dedicated link, which typically exists between a Host and a Switch, or between two Switches. It cannot be used on a shared hub (bus).
Question 215
Question: The TCP transmitter window control algorithm passes from the slow-start phase to the congestion avoidance phase (AIMD):
Option A: Upon signaling from the receiver.
Option B: When the current window reaches a threshold value.
Option C: Upon the expiration of a timeout.
Option D: As soon as an out-of-sequence acknowledgment is received.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: TCP maintains a variable called ssthresh (Slow Start Threshold). When the Congestion Window ($cwnd$) grows to reach this threshold, TCP switches from the exponential growth of Slow Start to the linear growth of Congestion Avoidance to carefully probe for bandwidth without causing immediate congestion.
Question 216
Question: In a virtual circuit packet switching network, the routing algorithm applies in the switching nodes:
Option A: To all received packets.
Option B: Only to virtual circuit opening and closing request packets.
Option C: Only to data packets.
Option D: Only to virtual circuit opening request packets.
Correct Answer: D
Motivation: In Virtual Circuit networks, the complex "Routing" (path calculation) happens only once, during the Setup Phase (Opening Request). Once the path is established and entries are made in the switching tables, data packets are simply "Forwarded" based on their labels (Label Swapping), which is a much simpler lookup process than full routing.
Question 217
Question: Which of these statements regarding peer-to-peer architectures is false?
Option A: They are self-scaling, meaning performance does not change drastically as the number of peers varies.
Option B: Peers are located in large data centers and are managed by the same administrator.
Option C: Resources usually remain accessible even if some peers are turned off.
Option D: Peers can change their IP address over time.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: The definition of Peer-to-Peer (P2P) is decentralized control. Peers are typically user devices (PCs, laptops) located at the "edge" of the network, owned by different individuals, not centralized servers in a data center managed by a single entity (which describes the Client-Server model).
Question 218
Question: Which of these statements regarding datagram routing in IP networks is true?
Option A: It is performed by routers based on the destination IP address.
Option B: It is performed by routers based on the source IP address.
Option C: It is performed by routers based on the virtual-circuit (VC) identifier.
Option D: IP is based on circuit switching, so no routing is performed.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: IP is a destination-based routing protocol. Every router looks at the Destination IP Address in the packet header, consults its routing table to find the longest matching prefix, and forwards the packet to the corresponding next hop.
Question 219
Question: The fact that the PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol) operates on point-to-point links implies, among other things:
Option A: That PPP must use MAC layer addresses to distinguish sender and receiver.
Option B: That it is not necessary to use addresses in the PPP header.
Option C: That PPP must send the identity of the recipient to the upper layers.
Option D: That PPP frames have a fixed length.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: On a dedicated point-to-point link, there is no ambiguity about where the data goes: whatever is sent by one end is received by the other. Therefore, unlike Ethernet (shared medium), addressing is technically redundant. (Note: PPP frames often include a dummy address byte 0xFF for standard compliance, but it is not "necessary" for routing).
Question 220
Question: Which of the following measures is necessary to make the operation of a window protocol more robust in case of a non-sequential channel between transmitter and receiver?
Option A: Use of cumulative acknowledgments.
Option B: Increase of bits in the address fields of data units.
Option C: Choice of transmission and reception windows of equal size.
Option D: Increase of bits used for numbering data units.
Correct Answer: D
Motivation: If a channel is non-sequential (reordering occurs), old packets can arrive late. If the sequence number space is small, an old packet (e.g., #5) might be confused with a new packet with the same number (wrapped around). Increasing the number of bits for sequence numbers makes the cycle much longer ($2^k$), ensuring old packets "die" (TTL) before their number is reused.
Question 221
Question: Which of these statements regarding the TCP retransmission mechanism is false?
Option A: The reception of a triple duplicate ACK causes the retransmission of the oldest segment awaiting confirmation.
Option B: A timeout causes the retransmission of the oldest segment awaiting confirmation.
Option C: A timeout causes the retransmission of all segments awaiting confirmation.
Option D: The reception of an ACK cumulatively confirms also all previous segments.
Correct Answer: C
Motivation: Modern TCP implementations (like Reno/NewReno) typically retransmit only the segment that timed out (the oldest unacknowledged one), or use SACK to identify specific gaps. Retransmitting all unacknowledged segments (Go-Back-N style) upon every timeout is inefficient and not standard behavior for modern TCP.
Question 222
Question: Which of these statements regarding DASH (Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP) is false?
Option A: It relies on the availability of versions of the same multimedia content encoded at different bit rates.
Option B: It produces messages that are enveloped in RTP to implement telephony over the Internet.
Option C: It achieves a compromise between available bandwidth in the network and quality of multimedia content.
Option D: It is used for streaming multimedia content over HTTP.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: DASH uses HTTP (TCP) to download video chunks. It does not use RTP/UDP. The logic is: the client requests video chunks via standard HTTP GET requests, selecting the appropriate quality level (bitrate) for current network conditions. RTP is used for VoIP/RTSP, which is a different technology stack.
Question 223
Question: In datagram packet switching, it is foreseen:
Option A: An assignment of transmission resources for the sole duration of the packet transmission.
Option B: A statistical choice between frequency multiplexing and time multiplexing.
Option C: A preventive assignment of transmission resources based on source activity statistics.
Option D: A permanent assignment of transmission resources to different information flows.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: This is the concept of Statistical Multiplexing. Resources (link bandwidth) are not reserved for the duration of a session (like in circuits). They are occupied by a user only for the milliseconds it takes to transmit their specific packet. Once the packet passes, the resource is immediately free for others.
Question 224
Question: The TCP protocol dynamically varies the size of the current window at the transmitter to obtain:
Option A: The window does not vary.
Option B: Both flow control and congestion control.
Option C: Only congestion control.
Option D: Only flow control.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: The effective transmission window is $\min(rwnd, cwnd)$.
                              * Flow Control: The receiver adjusts rwnd to prevent buffer overflow.
                              * Congestion Control: The sender adjusts cwnd based on network traffic (packet loss).
Both mechanisms dynamically influence how much data the transmitter can send.
Question 225
Question: Which of the following is NOT an example of multiple access?
Option A: A switch transmitting packets on an output interface in a packet-switching network.
Option B: Aloha stations towards the Master station.
Option C: Smartphones transmitting towards a base station of a cellular network access network.
Option D: Transmissions of computers equipped with WIFI cards towards an Access Point.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: A switch output port is typically a point-to-point link (in full duplex) or a controlled queue. The switch is the only device transmitting onto that specific wire (towards the next node). There is no contention or "multiple" independent transmitters trying to access that single output wire simultaneously in the shared-medium sense. B, C, and D all involve multiple independent nodes competing for a shared medium (Air).
Question 226
Question: There exists at least one tree topology with 5 nodes and 4 channels in which, if a channel is added between two nodes not directly connected to each other, the topology:
Option A: Becomes a ring topology (or contains a ring).
Option B: Remains a tree topology.
Option C: Becomes a star topology.
Option D: Becomes a fully connected topology.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: By definition, a Tree is an acyclic graph. Adding any link between two existing nodes in a tree creates a Cycle (Loop). If the tree was a simple line (chain), connecting the ends makes it a Ring. While "Becomes a ring" is a specific geometric case, "Creates a cycle" is the topological truth. Option A is the only one describing the formation of a loop/ring structure.
Question 227
Question: Which of these statements regarding DHCP is false?
Option A: DHCP dynamically provides an IP address to a host that requests it.
Option B: Among the information provided by the DHCP server, there is also the default gateway address.
Option C: DHCP messages are enveloped in UDP datagrams sent in broadcast.
Option D: In a network, there can exist at most one DHCP server.
Correct Answer: D
Motivation: For redundancy and fault tolerance, it is common and perfectly valid to have multiple DHCP servers on the same network. The client accepts the first offer it receives.
Question 228
Question: In the IP header (IP protocol PCI), the following is obligatorily contained:
Option A: The source MAC address, useful for sending replies to received packets.
Option B: The Time To Live (TTL) field which allows the elimination from the network of packets that have crossed an excessive number of routers.
Option C: The ACK Number field for acknowledgment numbering.
Option D: The CODE field, containing SYN, FIN, and ACK flags for connection opening and closing.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: The TTL (Time To Live) is a crucial field in the IPv4 header to prevent routing loops from circulating packets forever.
                                 * MAC addresses are in the Ethernet header.
                                 * ACK Numbers and Flags (SYN/FIN) are in the TCP header.
Question 229
Question: A link state routing algorithm provides that:
Option A: Every node of the network communicates to all nodes of the network the information on the cost of transmission towards the nodes adjacent to it.
Option B: Every node of the network generates its own routing tables and then distributes them only to adjacent nodes.
Option C: Every node of the network communicates to adjacent nodes the information on the cost and direction of paths leading to every possible destination.
Option D: Every node of the network generates its own routing tables and then distributes them to all other nodes of the network.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: Link State algorithms (like OSPF) rely on Flooding. Each node tells the entire network about its local neighbors (Link State). Once a node has this info from everyone, it builds a complete map of the network and calculates the best paths locally. Option C describes Distance Vector (telling neighbors about everything).
Question 230
Question: In an Ethernet network where terminals are connected in full-duplex mode to the ports of a switch via UTP cable:
Option A: The CSMA/CD access protocol is effectively useless because the switch separates collision domains between its ports.
Option B: The CSMA/CD access protocol is effectively useless because the switch works at bit rates greater than or equal to 1GB/s, making frames short-lived.
Option C: The CSMA/CD access protocol is still used for bit rates lower than 100Mb/s.
Option D: The CSMA/CD access protocol is still used, but only in the case where two transmissions start simultaneously.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: In a full-duplex switched environment, there are separate transmit and receive pairs for each link. There is no shared medium contention. Therefore, collisions are physically impossible, and the CSMA/CD algorithm (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection) is disabled/unused.
Question 231
Question: In a time interval T, a transmitting node using a Go-Back-N window protocol with a window of 5 PDUs transmits PDUs numbered 9, 10, 11 and receives ACK (cumulative) 8. Assuming the timeout has not expired and that ACK 8 is the one with the highest sequence number received so far, which of the following actions is allowed by the protocol rules in this situation?
Option A: Send PDU 12.
Option B: Send PDU 8.
Option C: Send PDUs 12 and 13.
Option D: No action until receipt of other ACKs.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation:
                                 * ACK 8 (cumulative) usually confirms everything before 8 and indicates "I am waiting for 8".
                                 * So the window starts at 8.
                                 * Window size = 5. Range allowed: 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
                                 * Transmitted so far: 8 (implied unacked), 9, 10, 11. (Total 4 outstanding).
                                 * Can I send more? Yes, space for one more (12).
                                 * Can I send 13? No, that would be the 6th packet.
                                 * Should I retransmit 8? No, timeout hasn't expired.
                                 * Therefore, sending PDU 12 is the valid move.
Question 232
Question: An (N)-PDU (Protocol Data Unit), passing to layer (N-1), transforms into:
Option A: One or more (N)-SDU (Service Data Unit).
Option B: One or more (N-1)-SDU (Service Data Unit).
Option C: One (N-1)-PCI (Protocol Control Information).
Option D: One or more (N-1)-SDU (Service Data Unit) to which N-PCIs are added.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: This describes Encapsulation. The entire packet created by Layer N (the N-PDU) is passed down to Layer N-1. From the perspective of Layer N-1, this whole block is just "data" to be transported. "Data to be serviced" is called the Service Data Unit (SDU). So, N-PDU becomes (N-1)-SDU.
Question 233
Question: The ARP protocol (Address Resolution Protocol) allows:
Option A: Obtaining an unknown IP address of a host starting from a domain name.
Option B: Sending error messages between routers.
Option C: Obtaining an unknown MAC address of a host starting from an IP address.
Option D: Obtaining an unknown IP address of a host starting from a MAC address.
Correct Answer: C
Motivation: ARP bridges Layer 3 and Layer 2. When a device knows the destination IP Address (Layer 3) but needs to construct the Ethernet frame, it broadcasts an ARP request ("Who has IP X?") to find the corresponding MAC Address (Layer 2).
Question 234
Question: Which of these statements regarding the Web cookie is false?
Option A: A browser in possession of a cookie includes it in subsequent requests to the relative HTTP server.
Option B: The browser creates a different cookie every time it accesses the same HTTP server.
Option C: The cookie is created by the HTTP server when a browser accesses it for the first time.
Option D: The cookie is stored by the browser in the client host's file system.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: Cookies are created by the Server (Set-Cookie header) to identify a session. The browser's job is simply to store it and send it back (Cookie header) unchanged in future requests. The browser does not create a new cookie itself every time; that would defeat the purpose of maintaining a persistent session state.
Question 236
Question: In the event that an error in the forwarding table configuration on routers generates a closed loop in the network, which of these statements is true?
Option A: A datagram circulating on such a path is sooner or later eliminated by routers based on the TTL field.
Option B: The spanning tree protocol avoids the onset of these problems before they occur.
Option C: A datagram can circulate on such a path infinitely.
Option D: A datagram circulating on such a path is sooner or later eliminated by routers, which identify it by comparing the content with copies kept in the local cache.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: The TTL (Time To Live) field in the IP header is a counter that is decremented by 1 at every router hop. When it reaches 0, the packet is discarded. This mechanism specifically exists to prevent packets from looping infinitely during routing errors. (Spanning Tree is for Layer 2 switches, not Layer 3 routers).
Question 237
Question: The transmission delay of a PDU in a packet switching network:
Option A: Depends on the PDU size and the distance between transmitter and receiver.
Option B: Depends only on the transmitter bit rate.
Option C: Depends on the transmitter bit rate and the distance between transmitter and receiver.
Option D: Depends on the transmitter bit rate and the PDU size.
Correct Answer: D
Motivation: Transmission delay is the time required to push all the bits of the packet onto the wire. It is calculated as $L / R$, where $L$ is the packet length (Size) and $R$ is the link bandwidth (Bit Rate). Distance affects Propagation delay, not Transmission delay.
Question 238
Question: Consider an extended Ethernet LAN whose nodes are interconnected by transparent switches. Which of the following statements is false?
Option A: Switches can support the creation of Virtual LANs (VLANs).
Option B: Switches introduce an additional delay in transmissions between nodes connected via the switches themselves.
Option C: It is necessary to modify the configuration of nodes connected to the LAN to allow correct routing of MAC frames between switches.
Option D: Switches separate the collision domains of the interconnected network portions.
Correct Answer: C
Motivation: Switches are Transparent. They operate at Layer 2 and learn addresses automatically ("Source Learning"). The end hosts (nodes) are completely unaware of the switches' existence; they configure their network interfaces exactly as if they were connected to a simple cable. No special configuration is needed on the nodes.
Question 239
Question: Regarding the reception of an out-of-sequence segment in TCP, which of these statements is true?
Option A: Segment reordering is the responsibility of the RTP protocol.
Option B: The receiver immediately delivers the segment to the upper protocol layers.
Option C: The receiver always discards the segment which will have to be transmitted again.
Option D: The receiver returns an acknowledgment number referring to the next expected byte.
Correct Answer: D
Motivation: If TCP receives a segment out of order (e.g., receives 3 while waiting for 2), it typically buffers it (to save bandwidth) but cannot acknowledge it directly because ACKs are cumulative. Instead, it sends a Duplicate ACK for the segment it is still waiting for (Packet 2), effectively saying "I still need 2".
Question 240
Question: For the same number of information bits transmitted, which of the following line encodings requires a higher bit rate at the physical layer?
Option A: 4B5B Coding.
Option B: NRZ Polar Coding.
Option C: Manchester Coding.
Option D: Unipolar Coding.
Correct Answer: C
Motivation:
                                 * NRZ/Unipolar: 1 baud = 1 bit. Rate = R.
                                 * 4B5B: 5 baud = 4 bits. Rate = 1.25 R.
                                 * Manchester: 1 bit = 2 voltage transitions (mid-bit transition). Rate = 2 R.
Therefore, Manchester coding requires double the bandwidth (highest baud rate) for the same data throughput.
Question 241
Question: During the slow-start phase of the TCP protocol congestion control, the transmitter's current window:
Option A: Grows by one segment for each acknowledgment (ACK) received.
Option B: Doubles for each acknowledgment (ACK) received.
Option C: Is halved for each missing acknowledgment (ACK).
Option D: Remains constant over time.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: In Slow Start, $cwnd = cwnd + MSS$ for every ACK. Since a window of size $W$ generates $W$ ACKs, the window size effectively doubles every Round Trip Time (RTT). The growth is exponential, but the mechanism is "+1 per ACK".
Question 242
Question: Which of the following performances are possible thanks to Store & Forward functioning in a packet network?
Option A: The possibility of having different transmission speeds between the different channels attached to the same switch.
Option B: The reduction of information transfer delays through a switching node.
Option C: The possibility of using forward error correction type channel encodings.
Option D: The reduction of the size of packet headers.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: Buffering the entire packet (Store) allows the switch to decouple the input link from the output link. It can receive a packet slowly from a 10 Mbps link, store it, and then blast it out onto a 1 Gbps link (or vice versa). Without storage, the bits would have to flow through at the speed of the slowest link instantly.
Question 243
Question: The IP Protocol:
Option A: Guarantees error detection only on the datagram content.
Option B: Does not provide any type of error protection.
Option C: Guarantees error detection on the datagram header and content.
Option D: Guarantees error detection only on the datagram header.
Correct Answer: D
Motivation: IPv4 uses a Header Checksum. It verifies the integrity of the routing information (IP addresses, TTL, etc.) to prevent misrouting. It does not verify the payload (data); data integrity is left to the Transport Layer (TCP/UDP) or Link Layer (CRC).
Question 244
Question: An IP router, after calculating the routing:
Option A: Modifies the source and destination IP addresses in the datagram header.
Option B: Modifies exclusively the Time To Live (TTL) field in the datagram header.
Option C: Modifies exclusively the Header Checksum field in the datagram header.
Option D: Modifies the Time To Live and Header Checksum fields in the datagram header.
Correct Answer: D
Motivation: The router decrements the TTL. Since the TTL is part of the header, modifying it changes the checksum of the header. Therefore, the router must re-calculate and update the Header Checksum before forwarding.
Question 245
Question: The Stop & Wait protocol:
Option A: Can function using a number of numbering bits greater than or equal to 1.
Option B: Can function only using more than one numbering bit.
Option C: Can function only using a number of numbering bits lower than the transmission window size.
Option D: Can only function using a single numbering bit.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: Stop & Wait needs to distinguish between "Current Packet" and "Next Packet" (or "Old Duplicate"). A single bit (0 vs 1) is sufficient. Using more bits works fine (it's just a subset of Go-Back-N), but $\ge 1$ is the requirement.
Question 246
Question: The TCP transmission window control algorithm passes from the slow-start phase to the congestion avoidance phase (AIMD):
Option A: Upon signaling from the SIP receiver.
Option B: Upon the expiration of the timeout.
Option C: As soon as an out-of-sequence acknowledgment is received.
Option D: When the current window reaches a threshold value.
Correct Answer: D
Motivation: Repeat of Q215. The transition occurs when cwnd >= ssthresh.
Question 247
Question: Which of the following is a consequence of increasing the number of numbering bits in the data units of a window protocol?
Option A: Increase in the number of possible virtual circuits.
Option B: Increase in malfunctions due to non-sequential channel between transmitter and receiver.
Option C: Potential increase in protocol throughput.
Option D: Failure to detect collisions on broadcast channel.
Correct Answer: C
Motivation: More bits for sequence numbers allow for a larger Window Size ($N < 2^k$). A larger window allows more data to be "in flight" (filling the pipe), which increases throughput, especially on high-bandwidth or high-latency links (High Bandwidth-Delay Product).
Question 248
Question: Which of these statements regarding TCP slow start is false?
Option A: Upon reaching a threshold (ssthresh) it switches to congestion avoidance mode.
Option B: It is based on an exponential increase of the congestion window (cwnd).
Option C: It keeps throughput constantly low in TCP to avoid network congestion.
Option D: It is executed following a timeout event occurring on the connection.
Correct Answer: C
Motivation: "Slow Start" is a misnomer; it is actually very aggressive. It doubles the window every RTT. Its goal is to quickly ramp up throughput to utilize available bandwidth, not to keep it low. It only starts low (1 MSS) but grows fast.
Question 249
Question: Flow control in TCP:
Option A: Bases its operations on the receive window (rwnd) field in the TCP segment header.
Option B: Is managed by the default gateway which limits the throughput of datagrams sent in the network.
Option C: Bases its operations on the TCP timeout and on the reception of duplicate ACKs.
Option D: Requires the establishment of a virtual circuit through intermediate routers.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: Flow control is the mechanism used to prevent a fast sender from overwhelming a slow receiver. In TCP, the receiver explicitly communicates how much buffer space it has available in the Receive Window (rwnd) field of every segment it sends. The sender must limit the amount of unacknowledged data "in flight" to this value. Option C refers to Congestion Control.
Question 251
Question: Regarding line coding and digital modulation, if the spectrum of the signal x(t) consists of Dirac deltas spaced apart:
Option A: They can both be used for transmission on radio media.
Option B: They can only be used for transmission on electrical media.
Option C: They can be used only for transmission on electrical media (the first) and radio media (the second).
Option D: They can both be used for transmission on optical fiber.
Correct Answer: D
Motivation: The spectral characteristics described (discrete lines vs continuous spectrum) generally refer to periodic signals or specific coding schemes. However, physically, both baseband line coding (e.g., NRZ, Manchester) and digital modulation (e.g., QAM, PSK) can be adapted for optical fiber transmission (e.g., modulating light intensity or phase). The question seems to imply a theoretical context, and option D is verified as correct in the source, likely emphasizing the versatility of digital formats on high-bandwidth media like fiber.
Question 252
Question: In a Selective Repeat protocol with a reception window of 2 PDUs, initially positioned on sequence numbers 0 and 1, the following reception of PDUs in the indicated order does NOT determine a discard of PDU:
Option A: 0, 3, 1, 2
Option B: 2, 0, 1, 3
Option C: 0, 2, 3, 1
Option D: 1, 0, 3, 2
Correct Answer: D
Motivation:
                                    * Window is [0, 1].
                                    * Sequence D (1, 0, 3, 2):
                                    * Rx 1: Inside window [0, 1]. Accepted and buffered. Window cannot slide (waiting for 0).
                                    * Rx 0: Inside window [0, 1]. Accepted. Now 0 and 1 are received. Window slides to [2, 3].
                                    * Rx 3: Inside window [2, 3]. Accepted and buffered.
                                    * Rx 2: Inside window [2, 3]. Accepted. Window slides.
                                    * All accepted. No discards.
                                    * Compare to A: Rx 0 (Slide to [1, 2]). Rx 3 (Outside [1, 2] -> Discarded).
Question 253
Question: A routing table contains simultaneously all four of the following entries. Identify the entry selected following the forwarding procedures for a datagram with destination 130.192.15.200.
Option A: 0.0.0.0/0
Option B: 130.192.14.128/25
Option C: 130.192.0.0/16
Option D: 130.192.15.128/25
Correct Answer: D
Motivation: Routers use the Longest Prefix Match rule. We compare the destination 130.192.15.200 against the options:
                                    * A (/0): Matches everything (length 0).
                                    * C (/16): 130.192.x.x. Matches (length 16).
                                    * D (/25): 130.192.15.128. Range is .128 to .255. 200 falls in this range. Matches (length 25).
                                    * B (/25): 130.192.14.128. Third octet is 14, does not match 15.
Option D has the longest prefix (25 bits) among the matches.
Question 254
Question: With the term "Roaming" in a cellular network, it is indicated:
Option A: The overlap of multiple cells in a certain area of the territory.
Option B: The possibility of tracking a terminal regardless of the cell it is located in.
Option C: The persistence of the connection even when passing into an adjacent cell.
Option D: The speed of movement of a terminal from one cell to another.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: In mobile networks (GSM/UMTS/LTE), Roaming specifically refers to the ability for a user to move outside their home network coverage area (e.g., abroad or into another operator's area) and still connect to the network to make/receive calls and data. The network must be able to "track" and locate the user to deliver services. Option C is better defined as "Handover".
Question 255
Question: A packet begins reception at a switching node at time $t=15ms$ and ends at $t=35ms$. Assuming there are no other packets in the queue and that processing time is negligible, its forwarding on an output channel having quadruple speed compared to the input one is completed at time:
Option A: t=40ms
Option B: t=45ms
Option C: Depends on propagation time towards destination
Option D: t=50ms
Correct Answer: A
Motivation:
                                       1. Reception Time ($T_{rx}$): $35ms - 15ms = 20ms$. This represents the serialization delay on the input link.
                                       2. Transmission Time ($T_{tx}$): Since the output speed is 4 times faster ($R_{out} = 4 \times R_{in}$), the transmission time is $T_{rx} / 4 = 20ms / 4 = 5ms$.
                                       3. Store & Forward: The switch must receive the entire packet (at $t=35ms$) before it can start sending.
                                       4. Completion: Start sending at $35ms$. End sending at $35ms + 5ms = 40ms$.
Question 256
Question: In a WiFi network, the sending of an ACK for a unicast frame by the receiver is:
Option A: Not necessary if the channel was reserved via RTS/CTS.
Option B: Mandatory only if the receiver is the Access Point.
Option C: Mandatory after waiting a NAV time.
Option D: Mandatory if the reception of the frame is correct.
Correct Answer: D
Motivation: In 802.11 (WiFi), the wireless medium is unreliable. Unlike Ethernet, collisions cannot be detected during transmission. Therefore, every successful unicast data frame must be positively acknowledged by the receiver sending a MAC-layer ACK frame. If the sender does not receive this ACK, it assumes the packet was lost and retransmits.
Question 257
Question: A source sends 12 PDUs using a Go-Back-N protocol with a transmission window equal to 5 PDUs, numbering them starting from 1. The first ACK is received after the end of the transmission of packet 5 and is ACK 2. Knowing that no timeout has expired, what action follows?
Option A: The source sends packet 3.
Option B: The source sends packet 6.
Option C: No action.
Option D: The source retransmits packet 2.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: ACK 2 is cumulative, confirming the successful receipt of previous packets (1 and 2) and sliding the window forward. This opens the window for new transmissions, authorizing the source to immediately send the next packet in the sequence, which is PDU 6.
Question 258
Question: Eliminating a bidirectional channel from a ring topology, the resulting topology:
Option A: Becomes a tree topology (specifically a linear/chain topology).
Option B: Becomes a passive star topology.
Option C: Remains a ring topology.
Option D: Becomes an active star topology.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: A ring topology is a single closed loop. If you cut one link (remove a channel) in a loop of $N$ nodes, you break the cycle. The result is an open chain of nodes. A chain is topologically a specific instance of a Tree (a connected graph with no cycles).
Question 259
Question: In data transmission over a radio channel, it is preferable to use:
Option A: A polar line coding like Manchester coding to facilitate synchronization recovery.
Option B: An nBmB type line coding to reduce bandwidth occupation.
Option C: A unipolar line coding to guarantee the DC component necessary for transmission.
Option D: A numerical modulation like 64-QAM to be able to transmit in the appropriate frequency band.
Correct Answer: D
Motivation: Radio channels require the signal to be shifted to a specific carrier frequency (passband transmission) to radiate effectively through antennas and share the spectrum. Baseband line codes (like Manchester, A/B/C) cannot be transmitted directly over radio. Digital Modulation (like QAM, PSK) is required to map bits onto a carrier wave's amplitude/phase/frequency.
Question 260
Question: An host must send a file of 4800 bytes using PDUs of 800 bytes with a PCI (header) of 100 bytes. What is the size of the last PDU sent?
Option A: 900 bytes
Option B: 100 bytes
Option C: 700 bytes
Option D: 800 bytes
Correct Answer: C
Motivation:
                                       1. Effective Payload per PDU: Total Size 800 - Header 100 = 700 bytes of data per packet.
                                       2. Number of Full Packets: $4800 \text{ total data} / 700 \text{ data per pkt} = 6.85$. This means 6 full packets and 1 partial packet.
                                       3. Data Sent in Full Packets: $6 \times 700 = 4200$ bytes.
                                       4. Remaining Data: $4800 - 4200 = 600$ bytes.
                                       5. Size of Last PDU: 600 bytes (Data) + 100 bytes (Header) = 700 bytes.
Question 261
Question: The segmentation of IP datagrams is an example of:
Option A: Generation of multiple 3-SDU from one 3-PDU.
Option B: Generation of multiple 2-SDU from one 3-SDU.
Option C: Generation of multiple 3-PDU from one 3-SDU.
Option D: Generation of multiple 2-SDU from one 3-PDU.
Correct Answer: C
Motivation: IP is Layer 3.
                                       * SDU (Service Data Unit): The data received from the layer above (payload).
                                       * PDU (Protocol Data Unit): The packet created by this layer (Header + Payload).
                                       * Segmentation: Taking one large payload (3-SDU) that is too big for the network and splitting it into multiple smaller IP packets (3-PDUs).
(Note: Source Answer is C. Technically, fragmentation splits an existing 3-PDU into smaller 3-PDUs, but conceptually it handles one large SDU by making multiple PDUs).
Question 262
Question: In a virtual circuit packet switching network, the number of labels used by a node for routing is proportional to:
Option A: The number of possible sources.
Option B: The sum of the average number of input and output channels from each node.
Option C: The number of active connections.
Option D: The number of possible destinations.
Correct Answer: C
Motivation: In Virtual Circuit (VC) switching, a label (VCI) identifies a specific active session/connection. It does not identify the destination host (which would imply option D). Every time a new call/connection is set up, a new label is allocated. Thus, label usage scales with traffic load (active connections).
Question 263
Question: In which of the following protocols is a form of error detection NOT provided?
Option A: Ethernet
Option B: IEEE 802.2 LLC (Logical Link Control)
Option C: PPP (Point-to-point Protocol)
Option D: IEEE 802.3
Correct Answer: B
Motivation:
                                          * Ethernet/802.3 has a CRC (FCS) in the trailer.
                                          * PPP has a CRC (FCS) in the trailer.
                                          * IEEE 802.2 LLC sits inside the data field of the MAC frame. It relies on the underlying MAC layer (Ethernet) to ensure frame integrity. The LLC header itself typically does not contain a checksum field.
Question 264
Question: In the event that an error in the forwarding table configuration on routers generates a closed loop in the network, which of these statements is true?
Option A: A datagram can circulate on such a path infinitely.
Option B: The spanning tree protocol avoids the onset of these problems before they occur.
Option C: A datagram circulating on such a path is sooner or later eliminated by routers, which identify it by comparing the content with copies kept in the local cache.
Option D: A datagram circulating on such a path is sooner or later eliminated by routers based on the TTL field.
Correct Answer: D
Motivation: IP routers do not cache packets to detect loops (C is false). Spanning Tree is for L2 switches (B is false). The TTL (Time To Live) field is specifically designed to prevent infinite loops (A is false). It decrements at each hop; when it hits 0, the packet dies.
Question 265
Question: A playout delay of 2 seconds:
Option A: Is compatible with streaming of stored content but not for VoIP.
Option B: Is compatible with both streaming of stored content and VoIP.
Option C: Is not compatible with either streaming of stored content or VoIP.
Option D: Is compatible with VoIP but not for streaming of stored content.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation:
                                          * Stored Streaming (YouTube/Netflix): A 2-second initial buffer/delay is perfectly acceptable. Users don't mind waiting 2 seconds for a movie to start.
                                          * VoIP (Interactive Audio): A 2-second delay makes conversation impossible. The maximum tolerable one-way delay for human interaction is about 150ms-400ms. 2000ms is far too high.
Question 266
Question: Which of these statements regarding UDP is true?
Option A: UDP automatically performs retransmission of datagrams for which no confirmation was received.
Option B: UDP implements flow control but not congestion control.
Option C: UDP implements both flow control and congestion control.
Option D: UDP allows multiplexing/demultiplexing thanks to the concept of a port.
Correct Answer: D
Motivation: UDP is a minimal transport protocol. It does not retransmit (unreliable), nor does it control flow or congestion. Its primary feature (besides encapsulation) is using Source and Destination Ports to allow multiple applications on the same host to send/receive data simultaneously (Multiplexing).
Question 267
Question: In the byte stuffing procedure:
Option A: The receiver discards every byte that corresponds to the delimiter used by the protocol.
Option B: The receiver discards the delimiter used by the protocol that precedes the escape byte.
Option C: The receiver discards the escape byte that precedes the delimiter used by the protocol.
Option D: The receiver discards every byte that corresponds to the escape byte used by the protocol.
Correct Answer: C
Motivation: Byte stuffing inserts a special "Escape" character (e.g., 0x7D) before a data byte that looks like a flag (e.g., 0x7E) to prevent the receiver from misinterpreting the data as a frame end. The receiver's job is to detect this Escape character, discard it, and treat the next character as regular data, not a flag.
Question 268
Question: In the case of stations all within radio range of each other, which of the following statements comparing Aloha and CSMA protocols is true?
Option A: Unlike CSMA, a station transmitting using Aloha needs a reception confirmation.
Option B: Unlike Aloha, a station using CSMA never collides with a transmission started a time ago greater than the maximum propagation delay.
Option C: Aloha transmissions can start at any time, while in CSMA they must be preceded by a channel reservation slot.
Option D: Unlike Aloha, in CSMA a station never collides with other stations.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation:
                                          * CSMA (Carrier Sense): A station listens before talking. If another station started transmitting long enough ago that the signal has reached the listener (Propagation Delay), the listener will hear it, sense the channel is busy, and refrain from transmitting. Thus, collisions are avoided for ongoing transmissions.
                                          * Aloha: Transmits blindly without listening. It will collide even if another station has been transmitting for a long time.
                                          * Note: Collisions in CSMA can still occur if two stations start transmitting within the small propagation delay window.
Question 269
Question: Which of the following statements is true, considering the classic operations of an IP router (excluding firewalls, NAT, etc.)?
Option A: A router modifies at least one IP address of the packets it must transmit.
Option B: A router uses ICMP messages to determine the path to follow to reach an Internet host.
Option C: A router IP uses the ARP protocol to know the IP address of the router to write as destination address in the IP packet.
Option D: A router modifies at least one MAC address of packets containing IP, but not the IP addresses.
Correct Answer: D
Motivation:
                                          * L3 (IP): Routers do not change Source/Dest IP addresses (unless NAT is active). They forward the IP packet intact (except TTL/Checksum).
                                          * L2 (MAC): To forward the packet to the next hop, the router must encapsulate the IP packet in a new Layer 2 frame. It sets its own MAC as Source and the Next Hop's MAC as Destination. Thus, MAC addresses change at every hop.
Question 270
Question: How many hosts can be managed at most in a network with netmask 255.255.255.128?
Option A: 254
Option B: 255
Option C: 126
Option D: 64
Correct Answer: C
Motivation:
                                          * Netmask 255.255.255.128 is a /25 prefix.
                                          * This leaves $32 - 25 = 7$ bits for the host part.
                                          * Total combinations: $2^7 = 128$.
                                          * Usable hosts: $2^7 - 2$ (minus Network Address and Broadcast Address) = $128 - 2 = 126$.
Question 271
Question: If a node using a window protocol receives a PDU out of sequence and with incorrect parity bits:
Option A: It discards the PDU and does not send any ACK.
Option B: It sends an ACK related to the sequence number contained in the PDU but discards the PDU.
Option C: It discards the PDU and sends an ACK of the expected sequence number.
Option D: It inserts the PDU in memory if it falls within the reception window, without sending any ACK.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: If the parity/checksum is incorrect, the packet is corrupted. The receiver cannot trust any content in the packet, including the sequence number. Therefore, it must blindly discard the packet as if it never arrived. It should not send an ACK because it doesn't know what it received. (If only out-of-order but valid, it would send a Duplicate ACK).
Question 272
Question: A frame received by an Ethernet card of a switch is processed to decide its routing:
Option A: Only if the destination MAC address is broadcast.
Option B: Only if the unicast destination MAC address corresponds to that of the switch.
Option C: Always, whatever the destination address.
Option D: Only if the destination MAC address is multicast and the switch belongs to the corresponding multicast group.
Correct Answer: C
Motivation: Switches operate in promiscuous mode regarding forwarding decisions. They must examine the destination MAC of every frame to look it up in the forwarding table (CAM) and decide whether to filter it (drop), forward it to a specific port, or flood it.
Question 273
Question: Compared to 1-persistent CSMA, non-persistent CSMA provides that:
Option A: After a collision, one waits a random time before trying to transmit.
Option B: The new listening of the channel, if found busy, occurs after a random time.
Option C: One waits a random time and then sends the frame on the channel.
Option D: Transmission occurs as soon as the channel becomes free.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation:
                                          * 1-Persistent: If channel busy, wait and listen continuously. Transmit immediately when free.
                                          * Non-Persistent: If channel busy, do not keep listening. Back off (wait) for a random time interval, then wake up and sense the channel again. This reduces collisions but increases latency.
Question 274
Question: The ICMP protocol (Internet Control Message Protocol) allows:
Option A: The exchange of error messages between routers and hosts.
Option B: Transferring email messages between host and host.
Option C: The exchange of error messages between TCP protocol and IP protocol.
Option D: Transferring a web page from a server to a client.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: ICMP is the  "diagnostics" companion of IP. It is used by routers and hosts to report errors (e.g., Destination Unreachable, TTL Exceeded) or network conditions (e.g., Echo Request/Reply for Ping) back to the sender.
Question 275
Question: In the TCP header (TCP protocol PCI), the following are obligatorily contained:
Option A: Some flags used for opening and closing the connection.
Option B: The current value of the congestion window.
Option C: The header checksum field, for error detection on the header only.
Option D: The value of the Maximum Segment Size negotiated between transmitter and receiver.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: The TCP header contains a Flags (Control Bits) field. This includes critical flags like SYN (Synchronize) for connection setup, FIN (Finish) for connection teardown, ACK, and RST. Option C is wrong because TCP checksum covers payload too. Option B is wrong because CWND is a local variable, not in the header.
Question 276
Question: In an ARQ (Automatic Retransmission reQuest) scheme with non-cyclic numbering, with window $Wt > 1$, the number of the first packet in the transmission window can refer to:
Option A: None of the other answers.
Option B: A packet transmitted by the transmitter, received by the receiver, and for which the transmitter has received the corresponding ACK.
Option C: A packet for which the receiver has no space in the buffer.
Option D: A packet transmitted by the transmitter, received by the receiver, and for which the transmitter has not yet received the corresponding ACK.
Correct Answer: D
Motivation: The transmission window starts at the oldest unacknowledged packet. This packet has definitely been transmitted (since it's in the window of "active" packets), but the transmitter has not yet received the ACK (otherwise the window would have slid forward past it).
Question 277
Question: In the CSMA-CD protocol, a station completes the transmission of a frame:
Option A: Only if it has the highest priority compared to the station it collides with.
Option B: Only if, listening to the channel, no simultaneous reception to the ongoing transmission is detected.
Option C: Always after having started it.
Option D: Only if it receives an ACK frame from the receiver.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: This describes the Collision Detection (CD) mechanism. While transmitting, the station simultaneously listens. If it detects another signal interfering with its own (voltage spike/anomaly), it aborts the transmission immediately (sends a jam signal). It only "completes" the transmission if it finishes the entire frame without detecting interference.
Question 278
Question: If a node using a Selective Repeat protocol receives a PDU with a sequence number inside the reception window but with incorrect parity bits:
Option A: It discards the PDU and does not send any ACK.
Option B: It discards the PDU and sends an ACK of the expected sequence number.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: Similar to Q271. A packet with a bad CRC/parity is corrupted garbage. The receiver must ignore it completely. It cannot send a NACK (usually) or an ACK because it shouldn't assume it knows which packet it was. In Selective Repeat, silence usually triggers the sender's timeout or is handled by subsequent ACKs, but the immediate reaction to a corrupted packet is "Drop and Silence".
Question 279
Question: Which of these CANNOT be a network ID?
Option A: 130.192.55.0/16
Option B: 130.192.55.0/24
Option C: 130.192.16.0/20
Option D: 130.192.16.0/24
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: A valid Network ID must have all host bits set to 0.
                                          * A (130.192.55.0/16): Prefix is 16 bits (130.192). The host part is the last 16 bits (55.0). Since 55 is not 0, this is not a valid Network ID (it's a host IP or subnet IP within that block).
                                          * B (/24): Host part is .0. Valid.
                                          * C (/20): 20 bits mask. The 3rd octet 16 is 00010000. The first 4 bits are part of network. Host part is last 12 bits. Last 4 bits of 16 are 0. Valid.
Question 280
Question: A source must send 6 PDUs using a Go-Back-N protocol with cumulative ACKs and a transmission window of 3 PDUs, numbering them starting from 1. After the transmission of the first window, and before the timeout expires, the only confirmation received is ACK 3. Which of the following actions is plausible to be executed by the source?
Option A: The source retransmits PDU 2.
Option B: The source sends PDUs 3 and 4.
Option C: The source sends PDUs 4 and 5.
Option D: The source sends nothing else and awaits timeout.
Correct Answer: C
Motivation: ACK 3 cumulatively confirms that PDUs 1, 2, and 3 arrived safely, causing the window to slide forward by three positions. This opens the window for new data, allowing the source to immediately transmit the next packets in the sequence (4 and 5). If timeout expired then 1,2,3
Question 281
Question: Which field in the IP header is used to prevent a packet from being forwarded by more than N routers?
Option A: Destination Address.
Option B: Version.
Option C: None of the answers.
Correct Answer: C
Motivation: The mechanism is the TTL (Time To Live) field. Since this specific field was not listed in the explicit options A or B (which were Destination Address and Version), the correct choice among the provided options is "None of the above".
Question 282
Question: In a WiFi network, the use of RTS/CTS messages:
Option A: Eliminates collisions with other stations.
Option B: Reduces the probability of collision between stations.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: RTS/CTS (Request To Send / Clear To Send) mitigates the Hidden Node Problem. By reserving the medium before the large data frame is sent, it prevents hidden nodes from transmitting during the data phase. However, collisions can still occur on the RTS frame itself. Thus, it reduces probability but does not completely eliminate collisions.
Question 283
Question: Which of the following statements about NAT is true?
Option A: NAT uses an IP address/port combination to create associations between internal hosts and Internet destinations.
Option B: Port forwarding is necessary to allow communication between internal network hosts towards the Internet.
Option C: NAT assigns IP addresses dynamically to internal network hosts requesting them.
Option D: It is always possible to contact internal network hosts from the Internet without special additional solutions.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: This describes NAPT (Network Address Port Translation) or PAT. The NAT router maintains a translation table mapping (Internal IP, Internal Port) $\leftrightarrow$ (External IP, External Port). This allows multiple internal hosts to share a single public IP address by using unique ports to distinguish the return traffic.
Question 284
Question: Which of the following is NOT a network ID?
Option A: 0/2
Option B: 130.192.36.128/25
Option C: 13.0.0.0/8
Option D: 192.168.16.0/16
Correct Answer: D
Motivation:
                                          * D (192.168.16.0/16): A /16 mask means the Network part is the first 2 octets (192.168). The Host part is the last 2 octets (16.0). For this to be a Network ID, the Host part must be all zeros. 16.0 is not zero ($16 \ne 0$). The Network ID for this prefix would be 192.168.0.0. Therefore, D is an IP address inside the subnet, not the Network ID itself.
                                          * Check B: /25. 128 is 10000000. Host part is 7 bits (all 0). Valid.
Question 285
Question: To a router can be associated:
Option A: Only one IP address.
Option B: Multiple IP addresses.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: A router connects multiple networks. By definition, it must have at least one interface for each network it connects. Each active interface requires its own unique IP address belonging to that network. Therefore, a router always has multiple IP addresses.
Question 286
Question: The Aloha protocol starts transmitting:
Option A: After listening to the channel, hearing it free.
Option B: Independently of the channel state.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: Pure Aloha is an unslotted, random access protocol. It does not implement Carrier Sense (listening before talking). A node transmits immediately whenever it has data to send. If a collision occurs, it relies on ACKs (or lack thereof) to detect it and retry later.
Question 287
Question: The byte stuffing technique in the PPP protocol serves to:
Option A: Separate the header from the data field.
Option B: Correctly detect the start and end of the frame.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: PPP uses a specific "Flag" byte (0x7E) to delimit the beginning and end of a frame. If this byte pattern accidentally appears inside the user data payload, it would prematurely cut the frame. Byte stuffing (inserting an Escape byte 0x7D) ensures that any data byte resembling the flag is escaped, allowing the receiver to distinguish true Frame Delimiters from data.
Question 291
Question: Which of these statements regarding the HTTP 1.1 protocol is true?
Option A: HTTP 1.1 is based on a client-server paradigm.
Option B: HTTP 1.1 uses UDP at the transport layer.
Option C: HTTP 1.1 is natively stateful (not stateless).
Option D: HTTP 1.1 messages use binary encoding.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: HTTP is the classic example of Client-Server architecture (Browser asks, Server responds). It uses TCP (not UDP), it is stateless (without cookies), and HTTP 1.1 uses ASCII text encoding (not binary, unlike HTTP/2 or /3).
Question 292
Question: The fragmentation operation performed by IPv4 routers is an example of:
Option A: Generation of multiple 2-SDU from one 3-SDU.
Option B: Generation of multiple 3-SDU from one 3-PDU.
Option C: Generation of multiple 3-PDU from one 3-SDU.
Option D: Generation of multiple 2-SDU from one 3-PDU.
Correct Answer: C
Motivation: As in Question 261. An IP router takes a large packet (which acts as the SDU for the fragmentation process, or technically the payload of the original PDU) and splits it into multiple smaller IP packets (3-PDUs), each with its own IP header.
Question 293
Question: Associating a dynamic cost (e.g., channel load) to a transmission channel instead of a static cost (e.g., equal to 1 for all channels):
Option A: Can cause frequent modifications of the chosen path from a source to a destination.
Option B: Avoids possible oscillations in path choice caused by cost variation over time.
Option C: Is to be preferred in the case of packet switching but not circuit switching.
Option D: Reduces variations in path choice from a source to a destination.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: Route Oscillation: If costs update based on load, a heavily loaded link becomes expensive. Routing algorithms shift traffic to an idle link. The idle link then becomes heavily loaded (expensive), and the original link becomes idle (cheap). The routing algorithm shifts traffic back. This creates instability and frequent route flapping.
Question 294
Question: Consider a network consisting of a transmitter, an intermediate node, and a receiver. There are 2 packets, each lasting 10 ms (transmission time), which start arriving at the intermediate node at time $t=20$ ms. The channel connecting the intermediate node with the receiver has double the speed compared to the channel connecting the transmitter with the intermediate node. Assuming there is no time gap between the 2 packets, that there are no other packets in the queue, and that processing time is negligible, at what instant of time is the transmission completed?
Option A: 40ms
Option B: 50ms
Option C: 45ms
Option D: 70ms
Correct Answer: C
Motivation:
                                          * Packet Duration ($L/R_1$): 10 ms.
                                          * Arrival at Intermediate: Pkt 1 arrives $20$ to $30$. Pkt 2 arrives $30$ to $40$.
                                          * Output Speed ($R_2$): Double $R_1$. So $L/R_2 = 5$ ms.
                                          * Store & Forward Logic:
                                          * Pkt 1: Fully received at $t=30$. Transmission starts at 30. Ends at $30 + 5 = 35$.
                                          * Pkt 2: Fully received at $t=40$. (Link 2 is free since 35). Transmission starts at 40. Ends at $40 + 5 = 45$.
                                          * Total completion time = 45 ms.
Question 295
Question: A node must send 2200 bytes of data, using PDUs of 900 bytes with PCI of 100 bytes, on a channel with transmission speed equal to 4Mbit/s. How much time is necessary for the transmission of the last packet?
Option A: 1.4ms
Option B: 1.8ms
Option C: 1ms
Option D: 5ms
Correct Answer: A
Motivation:
                                          1. Data per PDU: $900 - 100 = 800$ bytes.
                                          2. Split Data: $2200 / 800 = 2$ full packets (covering 1600 bytes) + 600 bytes remainder.
                                          3. Last PDU Size: 600 bytes (Data) + 100 bytes (Header) = 700 bytes.
                                          4. Bits: $700 \times 8 = 5600$ bits.
                                          5. Time: $5600 \text{ bits} / 4,000,000 \text{ bps} = 0.0014 \text{ s} = \mathbf{1.4 \text{ ms}}$.
Question 296
Question: Given a 100Mbit/s channel sharing 2 TCP connections of 30Mbit/s (attempted/max) and 2 UDP connections of 40Mbit/s. Which of the following statements is correct?
Option A: UDP connections block TCP connections.
Option B: TCP connections have a transmission speed of 25Mbit/s due to TCP Fairness.
Option C: UDP connections have a transmission speed of 30Mbit/s, due to TCP congestion control.
Option D: TCP connections have a transmission speed of 10Mbit/s.
Correct Answer: D
Motivation:
                                          * Total Capacity: 100 Mbps.
                                          * UDP behavior: UDP is aggressive and does not back off. 2 UDP flows at 40 Mbps each = 80 Mbps total.
                                          * Remaining for TCP: $100 - 80 = 20$ Mbps.
                                          * TCP behavior: TCP flows share the remaining bandwidth fairly. 2 TCP flows share 20 Mbps.
                                          * Result: Each TCP connection gets $20 / 2 = \mathbf{10 \text{ Mbps}}$. (UDP effectively starves TCP).
Question 297
Question: Bluetooth:
Option A: Uses Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum modulation, short-range radio transmission, ISM Band, connected to a Master node in star topology.
Option B: Uses Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum modulation, long-range radio transmission, High Band.
Option C: Is used only by mobile telephony to transmit.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: Bluetooth (IEEE 802.15.1) is a WPAN technology. It operates in the 2.4 GHz ISM band using FHSS (hopping 1600 times/sec) to avoid interference. It organizes devices into a "Piconet" with one Master and up to 7 Slaves (Star topology).
Question 298
Question: Which of these is false for VoIP?
Option A: RTP provides mechanisms to guarantee real-time delivery.
Option B: RTP can be used for audio/video transfer.
Option C: SIP can be used to open and close a session.
Option D: SIP provides mechanisms to determine the address of the called party.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol) runs over UDP. While it provides services useful for real-time media (timestamps, sequence numbers, payload type), it cannot guarantee real-time delivery (low latency) or QoS. The network (IP/UDP) is best-effort. RTP helps manage the stream at the receiver, but it doesn't force the network to deliver packets faster.
Question 299
Question: Selective Repeat with $Wt=Wr=4$ and cumulative ACK semantics, in which the window transmission time is much smaller than RTT. Only PDUs 0, 1, 2, 3 must be transmitted. After the first transmission of the whole window, the receiver receives PDUs 0, 2, 3 (PDU 1 is lost). Assuming subsequently no packet is lost, what is the correct sequence the receiver sees arriving after the first reception of PDU 3?
Option A: 1
Option B: 1, 2, 3
Option C: 0, 1
Option D: 0, 1, 2, 3
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: This exercises confuses GBN with SR most likely A correct answer
Question 300
Question: What is the speed of WiFi technology nowadays?
Option A: Hundreds of Gigabit/s
Option B: On the order of Tbit/s
Option C: A few Gigabit/s
Option D: Tens of Mbit/s
Correct Answer: C
Motivation: Modern WiFi standards like WiFi 6 (802.11ax) and WiFi 7 (802.11be) support aggregate throughputs in the range of several Gigabits per second (e.g., 9.6 Gbps max theoretical for WiFi 6, even higher for WiFi 7). Tens of Mbps (D) is legacy (802.11g). Tbit/s (B) is not yet achievable.
Question 301
Question: The residential FTTx access network consists of:
Option A: A passive optical distribution network and, optionally, a terminal segment in copper.
Option B: Always entirely of an active optical distribution network.
Option C: A passive copper distribution network and, optionally, a terminal segment in optical fiber.
Option D: An optical distribution network based on IEEE 802.3 Gigabit Ethernet technology.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: FTTx (Fiber To The x) architectures often use PON (Passive Optical Network) technology for distribution, which uses passive splitters (no active electronics in the field). Depending on the specific variant (FTTC - Cabinet, FTTB - Building, FTTH - Home), the final leg (drop) might be copper (VDSL for FTTC) or fiber (FTTH).
Question 302
Question: A 16-QAM digital modulation:
Option A: Foresees sending 16 bits every symbol time.
Option B: Foresees sending 4 bits every symbol time.
Option C: Foresees sending 4 symbols every bit time.
Option D: Foresees sending 16 symbols every bit time.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation) modulates both amplitude and phase. "16-QAM" means there are $M=16$ possible distinct symbols (points in the constellation diagram). The number of bits per symbol is $\log_2(M)$. Since $\log_2(16) = 4$, each symbol carries 4 bits of information.
Question 303
Question: The servers implementing the distributed DNS database store resource records:
Option A: The A record serves to obtain an IP address given the host name.
Option B: The CNAME record serves to obtain the canonical name of a mail server.
Option C: The A record serves to provide requesting hosts with the canonical name related to a host name.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation:
                                          * A Record (Address): Maps a hostname to an IPv4 address.
                                          * CNAME Record (Canonical Name): Maps an alias to a canonical name.
                                          * MX Record: Used for Mail Servers.
Therefore, Option A describes the fundamental function of the A record correctly.
Question 304
Question: Which of the following statements regarding a standard IP router (without additional functionalities like firewall, NAT...) is true?
Option A: The router modifies at least one IP address of the packets.
Option B: The router forwards datagrams using frames; the output frame has at least one MAC address different from the incoming frame.
Option C: Hosts always communicate by passing through a router.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation:
                                             * A standard router does not change IP addresses (Source/Destination remain end-to-end).
                                             * However, to forward the packet on the next link, the router must encapsulate the IP datagram in a new Layer 2 frame. It sets the Source MAC to its own interface address and the Destination MAC to the next hop's address. Thus, MAC addresses change at every hop.
Question 305
Question: In the context of Link State (LS) routing algorithms, the routing table of a node:
Option A: Is used to calculate the minimum cost path towards other nodes.
Option B: Is compiled once the minimum cost path towards other nodes is known.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: The process order is:
                                             1. Link State Database: Collect topology info (LSA flooding).
                                             2. Dijkstra's Algorithm: Calculate the Shortest Path Tree from the database.
                                             3. Routing Table: Populate the table with the next hops derived from the Shortest Path Tree.
Therefore, the table is the result (compiled after calculation), not the tool used to calculate.
Question 306
Question: Port numbers in Layer 4 protocols:
Option A: Are present only in UDP.
Option B: Are present only in TCP.
Option C: Are present in both UDP and TCP.
Option D: Do not concern UDP and TCP protocols.
Correct Answer: C
Motivation: Both TCP and UDP provide process-to-process communication (multiplexing/demultiplexing). They both use 16-bit Source Port and Destination Port fields in their headers to identify the specific application (socket) sending or receiving data.
Question 307
Question: In a system with WIFI 802.11 protocol, two terminals A and B transmit simultaneously. What can happen?
Option A: Terminal B terminates transmission the moment it receives a NACK (Negative ACK).
Option B: Terminal B waits to receive an ACK.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: WiFi does not have a NACK mechanism for collision detection during transmission (it cannot detect collisions while sending). It relies on positive ACKs. If a terminal transmits, it will finish the packet and then wait for an ACK. If the ACK does not arrive (due to collision), it infers a loss and retries.
Question 308
Question: Adding a bidirectional channel between two nodes of a tree topology, what happens?
Option A: A ring (cycle) is always created.
Option B: A cycle is created.
Correct Answer: B
Motivation: A tree is defined as a connected graph with no cycles. Adding any edge (channel) between two existing nodes in a tree creates a path back to the start, forming a Cycle. (Note: Option A says "Anello" (Ring), which usually implies the whole topology becomes a ring, whereas Option B "Ciclo" (Cycle) is the precise graph theory term for the loop created within the structure).
Question 309
Question: In classless addressing, what is the prefix length in a network composed of 512 IP addresses?
Option A: 22
Option B: 23
Correct Answer: B
Motivation:
                                                * Total addresses needed: 512.
                                                * $512 = 2^9$.
                                                * This means 9 bits are required for the host part.
                                                * Prefix length (Network part) = $32 - \text{Host bits} = 32 - 9 = \mathbf{23}$.
(A /23 subnet provides $2^9 = 512$ addresses).
Question 310
Question: The DNS:
Option A: Uses UDP to resolve names into IP addresses.
Option B: Is a distributed server.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: Standard DNS queries (lookups) use UDP on port 53 for efficiency and speed (low overhead). TCP is used mainly for Zone Transfers or responses larger than 512 bytes. (Note: Option B is slightly imprecise terminology; DNS is a distributed database or system, but "A" is the specific protocol fact usually tested). Correction based on source key: The source might verify A or B depending on context. However, A is a definitive protocol fact.
Question 311
Question: The DHCP:
Option A: Configures IP network parameters on the local network.
Option B: Configures any network that requests it.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) relies on broadcast messages (Discover) which are limited to the local network segment (broadcast domain). Routers do not forward broadcasts by default (unless a DHCP Relay Agent is configured). Therefore, a DHCP server primarily services hosts on its local network/subnet.
Question 312
Question: In the ALOHA protocol, all stations use frames of the same duration. A station sends a frame that starts at time $t_0+1100$ and ends at time $t_0+1300$. In which of the following instants of the start of a transmission by another station does a collision occur?
Option A: $t_0+1370$
Option B: $t_0+890$
Option C: $t_0+910$
Option D: $t_0+1310$
Correct Answer: C
Motivation:
                                                   * Frame Start ($S_1$): 1100. Frame End ($E_1$): 1300.
                                                   * Frame Duration ($T$): $1300 - 1100 = 200$.
                                                   * Vulnerable Period: A collision occurs if another station starts transmitting ($S_2$) such that its frame overlaps with ours.
                                                   * It overlaps if it starts after our start minus $T$ (so its end hits our start).
                                                   * It overlaps if it starts before our end.
                                                   * Range: $(S_1 - T) < S_2 < (S_1 + T)$.
                                                   * Range: $(1100 - 200) < S_2 < (1100 + 200) \Rightarrow \mathbf{900 < S_2 < 1300}$.
                                                   * Check Options:
                                                   * A (1370): $> 1300$. No collision.

Question 313
Question: Using Selective Repeat with a transmission window of 10, numbering packets starting from 0, the source transmits the sequence of consecutive PDUs: 4, 5, 6. Upon acquiring the reception of ACK 9, assuming sequential channel and cumulative ACKs, which of the following statements is true?
Option A: It can transmit PDU 19.
Option B: It transmits PDU 8.
Option C: It transmits PDU 7.
Option D: It can transmit PDU 18.
Correct Answer: D
Motivation:
                                                   * Cumulative ACK 9: Confirms all packets up to 8. The receiver is expecting packet 9.
                                                   * Window Slide: The window moves to start at 9.
                                                   * Window Range: Start = 9. Size = 10. Range = [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18].
                                                   * Action: The sender is now allowed to transmit any packet in this range that hasn't been sent yet.
                                                   * Option D (PDU 18): 18 is the last sequence number inside the current window. Therefore, transmitting 18 is allowed.
                                                   * Option A (PDU 19): 19 is outside the window ($9+10 = 19$, so indices 0..9 are 9..18).
Question 314
Question: The introduction of subnet masks in Internet addressing:
Option A: Allows dividing a Class B network into multiple physical networks.
Option B: Allows using a single logical IP network over multiple physical networks.
Correct Answer: A
Motivation: Subnetting takes a large standard class network (like a Class B /16) and borrows bits from the host part to create a subnet field. This allows the organization to break the large block into smaller, manageable sub-blocks to assign to different physical LANs (subnets) interconnected by routers.
